    <content><![CDATA[<p>Los Angeles Clippers won, they home 105-94 revenge jazz, played a very tough victory. In this game, the Jazz really showed their offensive and defensive strength, especially Conley’s joining. Although Conley has not recovered his shooting bag at the offensive end, his tandem and defensive ability are still as tough as when he was in the Grizzlies, plus Mitchell’s horrible scoring ability. Clippers almost lost today because Leonard didn’t do well in the first half. But the adjustment ability of little card is amazing. In the second half, he burst out, with 18 points in the last section to finish the harvest.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don't be a bully/99ebe4840c2543ecae190541b77b4020.jpg" alt="12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don&#39;t be a bully"><br>According to the NBA data network, Leonard’s average score in the fourth quarter of this season has reached 12.6 points, ranking first in the League after he scored 18 points at the end of today’s quarter. There’s no doubt that Leonard has reached the ideal on the key ball. At the end of the day, you really have the feeling that Michael Jordan is airborne. Leonard’s old game is too lethal, especially the middle distance is very stable.<br>Many fans always think it’s a small ball era, the whole league is shooting three points, the middle distance is not very cost-effective. However, it has been proved that the middle distance is still a weapon to kill the enemy, especially when it is in deadlock and needs to approach the difference, the middle distance is absolutely the most stable scoring method. Of course, it’s not very much to be able to practice the middle distance to Leonard’s level.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don't be a bully/c89ea4bb80e84b76a26b637c4156631c.jpg" alt="12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don&#39;t be a bully"><br>As Sir Alex Snyder said, Leonard is showing himself on the defensive when he has a bad hand today. He used defense to make up for his own offensive side is not smooth, which makes the Clippers in Leonard’s offensive is not smooth, still rely on defense to laugh at the end. In addition, Snyder also mentioned that the enthusiasm of clippers was brought by Leonard, who grabbed 12 more offensive rebounds than jazz.<br>That is to say, the Clippers got 12 more attacking opportunities than the jazz. In this game, Leonard played 34 minutes, 9 of 26 shots, 2 of 3 points, 8 of 3, 10 of 12 free throws, got 30 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 steals.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don't be a bully/7b4930910768430caa22b43f67f9a58f.jpg" alt="12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don&#39;t be a bully"><br>Of course, it’s not good news for the Clippers that Leonard is the king of the last quarter, which means they need to play life and death ball when they are tired. The so-called good steel is used on the blade. Leonard’s best situation is to play in the first three quarters, and then the Clippers will play the game ahead of time. The regular season is still to ensure Leonard’s health.<br>And this task is given to Paul George. Today George has participated in the 3v3 training. Old rivers revealed that George is very likely to participate in the 5v5 training next week and is ready to return.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don't be a bully/4bdfef7c5ff743beba0c8dca895f8b7f.jpg" alt="12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don&#39;t be a bully"><br>As we all know, the starting fire of the clippers is indeed quite ordinary, seriously delaying. Today, in addition to Leonard, the other starting points of the Clippers are Patterson 0, Beverly 4, zubates 11, shamet 10. That is to say, after deducting Leonard’s score, the Clippers only scored 25 points in the first round, which is not enough.<br>So George’s role lies in this. He can increase the fire power of the clipper’s starting line and enhance the destructive power of the starting line at both ends of the attack and defense. In this way, the combination of Harrell and Ludwig in the second lineup of clippers can also be a big kill, but can continue to improve in place.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don't be a bully/f31129f6eef34d5da94f0e35a98af339.jpg" alt="12.6 League first! Leonard is the last king. George, come back and take care of him. Don&#39;t be a bully"><br>So don’t let Leonard continue to dominate the list. George can help Leonard get rid of the last king.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, Celtic narrowly beat Cleveland 119-113 away. Hayward is absolutely the main character in this game. After two years of hard waiting, he has gradually turned from the oil bottle of the green army to the magnate of the jazz era. We all know that Hayward suffered an ankle fracture in his first game when he joined Celtic two years ago, after which he was reimbursed for a season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/17+19+21! The champions did their best. It's no wonder Loew and Thompson. It's Hayward/49b502edfb3a477dbc7015d8c78e981e.jpg" alt="17+19+21! The champions did their best. It&#39;s no wonder Loew and Thompson. It&#39;s Hayward"><br>After Hayward’s comeback last season, his mobility and explosive power have been greatly reduced. At the same time, Tatum + Owen + Rozier were competing for the first place, and the whole dressing room was in a mess. Heywood has also been implicated because he has been put in the shoes of manager Stevens, which has led to dissatisfaction among some players. We all know Stevens’s relationship with Hayward. No matter how bad he played last season, Celtic are unconditionally supportive.<br>And that support paid off after a season. Hayward has once again become Stevens’s perfect player. To be the lubricant of the team at the offensive end. Today’s game process is indeed the same, Hayward resurrected and became an all-star giant.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/17+19+21! The champions did their best. It's no wonder Loew and Thompson. It's Hayward/3042e86a5677417892e96a2f205961fd.jpg" alt="17+19+21! The champions did their best. It&#39;s no wonder Loew and Thompson. It&#39;s Hayward"><br>From the first quarter on, Hayward took everyone’s lead, from layup to mid-range everything. Heywood cut 16 points and 2 boards in 7 of 7. Led Celtic 8 points ahead of Cavaliers. In the second quarter, the Celtic attack did not decrease, and Tatum also started the attack mode. He broke through the layup strongly, and hit a lot of Kobe Bryant’s feelings in a continuous mid shot. But Cavaliers can not be outdone, Clarkson and the combination of small South also began to work. Celtic were still nine points ahead at half-time.<br>In the second half, the two sides fell into a deadlock. Tatum and Hayward scored six points in a row, while the Knights’ side, Sexton and Loew Fu, scored five points in a row. Walker hit three points, Osman also scored three points, Hayward scored four points in a row, and NANs and knight scored six points in a row. Celtic led by six points at the end of the third quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/17+19+21! The champions did their best. It's no wonder Loew and Thompson. It's Hayward/6b035f02bdb34476bbe3d2aa1eb18873.jpg" alt="17+19+21! The champions did their best. It&#39;s no wonder Loew and Thompson. It&#39;s Hayward"><br>At the end of the game, Celtic started with a wave of flow, Hayward even scored 7 points, and Tatum also made two layups. Celtic pulled the difference to 12 at one point. But the Cavaliers didn’t give up hope. Osman raised his hand three times. TT Thompson also scored four points in a row. Loew and Sexton also started scoring mode, and the Cavaliers hit a 12-3 attack climax in the second half of the last quarter to reduce the difference to 3 points.<br>In the last minute, Sexton and Walker scored a three-point goal against each other, but Loew missed the layup at the last moment. And Hayward in the life and death of another offensive rebound and make-up to kill the game.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/17+19+21! The champions did their best. It's no wonder Loew and Thompson. It's Hayward/1d4c5cc689fb43ad9618ea2231e343ea.jpg" alt="17+19+21! The champions did their best. It&#39;s no wonder Loew and Thompson. It&#39;s Hayward"><br>There were no losers in today’s game. The Cavaliers did their best. They showed their tenacity. Whether it’s lofoy or Thompson, or sexton, the rookie has played their own standard. No wonder they don’t work hard, but today’s Hayward is too horizontal. It’s good to have 17 of 20 shooting rate and the Cavaliers put the game to the last minute.<br>Hayward scored 39 points, 7 rebounds and 8 assists, Walker 25 points, 8 rebounds and Tatum 18 points. Cleveland’s trident, Sexton 21 points, Tristan Thompson 19 points, 13 rebounds, lefo 17 points, 9 rebounds.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/17+19+21! The champions did their best. It's no wonder Loew and Thompson. It's Hayward/eb745d2692c94cdabc8bc48ba84871ee.jpg" alt="17+19+21! The champions did their best. It&#39;s no wonder Loew and Thompson. It&#39;s Hayward"><br>Cleveland’s champions have tried their best. Loew left in frustration, but Thompson still can’t be Cleveland’s boss. Celtic have a real chance to be a black horse this year, with Cavaliers at the bottom of the East. But the despised Celtic, their record and the heat 76 people fight each other, the East first hoped.</p>

    <title>18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard&#39;s passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/18%20points%20at%20the%20end!%20Zubates%20talked%20about%20Leonard&#39;s%20passion,%20and%20Lao%20Li%20brought%20good%20news%20to%20George/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Clippers beat the Jazz 105-94. In this competition, the leader of the clipper, Coway Leonard, undoubtedly became the main character of the whole game. In fact, today’s card in the first half of the performance is very bad. He got 5 points and 3 rebounds in 1-for-9 shooting, when some fans had prepared conference materials for Leonard to criticize. But Leonard left the conference room in the second half. He got 25 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals and 1 block in 17-8 shots after 9-1, with 18 points in the last quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard's passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George/69b0d75335c143028958be55a3dc835d.jpg" alt="18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard&#39;s passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George"><br>In the whole game, Leonard played 34 minutes, made 9 of 26 shots, got 30 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals and 1 block. It can be said that Leonard’s performance at the end of the day was amazing. Some fans said the clippers were set up to give Leonard the chance to harvest at the end of the season. But let’s think, isn’t it Leonard’s own style of playing and the clipper’s seamless connection?<br>What were we worried about when Leonard joined the Clippers? The worry is that Leonard will affect the way the Clippers play, so that their team can’t play basketball. Just like some teams, a single player with the ball, no matter what his teammates are like. It’s just doing it alone, making teammates turn back and run without enthusiasm.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard's passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George/71c498a0ed5649aca80b779c5db48c68.jpg" alt="18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard&#39;s passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George"><br>Leonard is totally different. He’s a player who doesn’t need to hold the ball for a long time. He’s a great ending point. And Leonard doesn’t throw too many shots when he doesn’t feel good, he does his best on the defensive side. In contrast, some team leaders, the offensive end of the big bag do not say, the defensive end is more diffuse, a critical moment to drop the chain.<br>Leonard, on the other hand, did not destroy the chemical reaction of the clipper, but brought what they needed, the ability to attack at the critical moment. So now there are only three players in the league who can be called Superstars: Leonard, James and Durant.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard's passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George/4cddbf11056f4665a183fbe348325c6d.jpg" alt="18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard&#39;s passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George"><br>The clippers were a good team last season, just like the Raptors. But they are short of players who can hold the scene at a critical moment. Because it’s not stable to play at the critical moment, and it’s afraid of being targeted. Leonard’s arrival undoubtedly gave the Clippers psychological advantages.<br>“In the third quarter, we were 10 points behind our opponents. At that time, I was on the bench, but I didn’t have the slightest fear and panic. Because we have Leonard. Then he did what we need him to do. When you need him, he will stand up and score. He is a real superstar   “<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard's passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George/57be1f180153448e8f35762486bb7bc7.jpg" alt="18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard&#39;s passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George"><br>It’s obvious that zubates has made his words very clear. Like the Raptors now, you say he’s very strong and really good. Without Leonard, he’s still in the top four in the East. But you have to say that the champion has won two consecutive titles, and they have no bottom in their hearts. Leonard is exactly the bottom.<br>In addition, the Clippers team is also very desperate, after the game old rivers praised two people Harrell and Beverly. Leonard old rivers stopped talking. He was too tired to talk.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard's passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George/d6a48aed44b44d4b841e84d0a90e5ad4.jpg" alt="18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard&#39;s passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George"><br>Old rivers thinks that there are two reasons for today’s big reversal of the clippers, one is Leonard’s ability to play a single without solution, the other is that the Clippers grabbed 18 offensive rebounds, of which Harrell grabbed 8 rebounds, 6 were offensive rebounds. In addition, Beverly grabbed nine rebounds. Old rivers thought that Beverly’s height and his ability to grab so many rebounds was really killing<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard's passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George/61d711c8507b499a8cd2da6fde6ea640.jpg" alt="18 points at the end! Zubates talked about Leonard&#39;s passion, and Lao Li brought good news to George"><br>Finally, old rivers also mentioned Paul George, who has participated in the 3v3 training today. Old rivers announced good news that George’s comeback is not far away. He expects George to start 5-5 training next week, and the Clippers will soon finish.</p>

    <title>20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/20+21+15!%20After%20Downes%20was%20banned,%20Wiggins%20became%20the%20boss/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a regular season game that ended today, Minnesota beat the Wizards 131-109 away. The Timberwolves star Downes was banned from the game because he was punished by the League for his work with the great embid in the last game. But today the Timberwolves are not in trouble because of Downes’s absence. They have a strong team for the first time and are very calm. In particular, another champion Lang Wiggins woke up. In the absence of Downes, Wiggins really put the team on his shoulders. Maybe as Wiggins told the team boss this summer, he is not ready to keep fit, but to fulfill his talent.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/751eaa44e8714886b2d9ea7acef65a48.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>Today’s game really shows the attitude of Wiggins. From the first quarter on, Wiggins has been unstoppable. At the beginning of the game, he quickly entered the state. He grabbed both ends of the attack and defense. In the first nine minutes, Wiggins got 10 points, 2 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 block. It was Leonard. It also gave Minnesota an 8-point lead of 42-34 in the first quarter.<br>The second section of the forest wolf attack momentum is not reduced, rookie Calver up is the slam dunk hit, TIG and Geon also attack the Wizards basket scoring. The forest wolf made a wave of 14-4 attacks. Although the Wizards star bill even cut 4 points in response, but Wiggins also hit 3 points with color. The Timberwolves led by 14 points at half-time, 70-56.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/e8def8a67abf4258b8c386a95b7f975f.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>In the second half, the Timberwolves were still brave. They were crazy. Covington hit 2-3 points in a row. Okogi got a pass from Wiggins and beat the layup. Wiggins also interfered with the Wizards on the defensive side many times. In the third quarter, Timberwolves scored 106 points, only the Wizards got 72 points. The Timberwolves took the lead to 34 points and beat the game directly. At the end of the day, there was nothing to fight between the two sides. The Wizards surrendered early.<br>In terms of data, the Timberwolves: Tiger 15 points, 13 AIDS, Wiggins 21 points, 5 boards, 6 AIDS, coventon 20 points, 15 + 21 + 20. These three people have become the three giants of today’s Timberwolves, affecting the game at both ends of attack and defense.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/4119b2245c2a4624891679d11102fcd7.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>On the Wizards side, Bill scored 30 points, but made six mistakes, while little Thomas got 16 points and 7 helpers. It’s a good start for the Timberwolves because they’ve been so bad in the past few years and the whole team is desperate. As a result, Downes and Wiggins became cancer and soft egg.<br>Now that the two top scorers are awake, Downes has made an incredible performance this season. Wiggins also began to slowly cash in the talent, at least at the defensive end of Wiggins out of the attitude, and do not grab the ball right. When it’s time to attack, I’m not careless. It’s very clear to play.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/82ba0285aeea41338faa0e520452abe1.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>In the absence of Downes, the Timberwolves can still maintain this state. It can only be said that they have ushered in a transformation. Now Downes can be a comfortable spectator and it’s no problem to give the team to Wiggins. At least until your ban is lifted, the Timberwolves can still keep going. After Downes returns, the Timberwolves can continue to play a wave of climax.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss/fd2a11b83d2a4e9296d49f85b5693ec1.jpg" alt="20+21+15! After Downes was banned, Wiggins became the boss"><br>The current lineup of the Timberwolves is not weak, TIG + Wiggins + Downes + Covington + Graham, in addition to Calvert on the bench. It’s time for the Timberwolves to play in the playoffs. Prove to Butler that without him, Wiggins and Downes can lead the team to the playoffs.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Suns beat the Grizzlies 114-105 away. It has to be said that the Suns have become the big black horses in the new season. When they started last season, they were very poor. But the Suns are really a strange team because they have an attribute. It’s just that playing the bucks is very tough. The sun played the Bucks last season and couldn’t take care of themselves. And this season the Suns will continue to play the Bucks, they start very strong. After today’s win, the Suns are 3-2. They won 3 games, which was unbelievable in the past.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins.

When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west"><br>Today’s match reflects the spirit of suns. They are totally different. Especially, the joining of Rubio this summer has liberated the pressure of Booker’s organization. He doesn’t need to be as dual-purpose as he used to be. He just needs to do a good job of breaking points. Booker is scoring at other times.<br>At the beginning of today’s first quarter, the sun showed its excellent firepower. Booker broke through, Rubio went through the needle, Baines could eat bread under the basket and protect the frame. Saric opened the space to cast three points, and ubre swam away. Johnson and Kaminsky’s reserve combination, is a contribution on the court. The Suns lead 7 points 31-24 in the first quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west/24764aefc5e740ffbc10ec58b542cd1c.jpg" alt="21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west"><br>In the second quarter, the sun once led by 12 points, but the Grizzlies began to strangle the sun’s outside line, so they didn’t let it go easily. With the touch of the sun, the Grizzlies start to fight back. Under the leadership of top scorer Morant, they hit a 16-2 attack wave to surpass 2 points. When the Suns were on the brink of extinction, the bench played again. Kaminsky made free throws in a row, the Suns were 2 points behind in half-time<br>After adjustment, the Suns finally found the hand in the second half. Baines hit two three points in a row, and ubre hit the basket to score two points and then made up the basket. Booker also shot in and out to score 5 points, and the sun was 5 points higher than the Grizzlies. But Booker continued to attack the Grizzlies, and the sun made another 16-2 attack, leading by 13 points at the end of the third quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west/499d225ed0d64fd0ae6b3cc6a5bbf681.jpg" alt="21 + 20 + 15 + 11! Four star break out and gain 3 wins. When Aton comes back, who can stop them in the west"><br>At the end of the game, the two sides fell into a deadlock. Anderson of Grizzlies hit three points, Brooks hit the basket and even got four points, Johnson also hit three points to respond, and Baines even got five points. The difference has been around 10 points, and finally shalich killed the game. At the last moment, he hit three points on the outside, and the Grizzlies could only surrender.<br>In the whole game, all four stars of the sun have delivered goods. Kobe Bryant scored 21 points and shot 8 out of 13, and shot 3 out of 3. It’s very reasonable and not indiscriminate. Baines scored 20 points and scored four-and-a-third, picking up the inside flag in the absence of Eaton. The flank’s ubre got 15 points, Rubio today feel bad 12 4, but also got 11 points 5 rebounds 6 assists data.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11!

But recently, Aton plans to apply to the League to reduce the number of banned matches. In addition, Aton will meet with the players’ Union and the NBA, hoping to reduce the ban.<br>If Aton can return ahead of time, then the sun can put on a terrifying starting five tigers: 1 Rubio + 2 buck + 3 ubre + 4 sharic + 5 Aton.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/21 + 20 + 15 + 11!

    <title>20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can&#39;t hold it</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/20%20boards%20+%2023%20boards%20+%2024%20boards!%20The%20pistons%20fail.%20Griffinross,%20come%20back.%20Zhuang%20Shen%20can&#39;t%20hold%20it/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Wizards beat the pistons 115-99 at home. The pistons missed three of the big players, Griffin is still in the recovery zone, Jackson is also absent, and Derek cross was injured before the high exemption. The piston can only rely on Drummond to fight against the banner. But we all know that when a team has only one core, it is easy to be targeted. Today, Zhuang Shen feels really bad. He only hit six goals in 20 shots and scored 15 points, 24 boards and 4 assists.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can't hold it/08c64a37cf7c46baaf297bcd195b33e4.jpg" alt="20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can&#39;t hold it"><br>In the past three games, Zhuang Shen has got 20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards and snatched 67 boards. At present, Drummond has become the first in the league with an average of 19.2 boards per game, and the rebounding king is basically arranged. But even in this way, it can’t lead the piston out of adversity. In today’s competition, the inner line of the piston depends on Zhuang Shen, and the outer line basically depends on Kennard.<br>In the first half, the pistons were able to fight against the wizards, but at the beginning of the second half, the pistons, who didn’t have enough firepower, were hit by the Wizards. At the beginning of today’s first quarter, both sides fell into hanging. Snell started with three points and Kennard made the free throw. The eight villages of the Wizards also responded with a 2 + 1 shot. Then Snell and little Thomas split up. The first piston is 1 point behind.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can't hold it/afe91ec307d249e49db0dd72e50ec292.jpg" alt="20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can&#39;t hold it"><br>In the second quarter, the Wizards hit a wave of current, miles cut 7 points in a row, and Morris also hit frequently on the outside line. At one point, the Wizards pulled the difference to 17. The pistons finally woke up. They began to find their hands to hit three points in a row. Kennard was even more unstoppable. Under his leadership, the pistons returned a wave of 16-2. At the end of half-time the difference was close to two.<br>In the second half, the Wizards attacked again and made a wave. Bryant scored four points in a row under the basket, Bill took the lead, and Morris was on the outside. The prodigy broke the piston’s wall once again and regained an 18 point lead. This time, the piston was unable to fight back. The three section piston is 15 percent behind.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can't hold it/e10ae56d462d41f0bde708552700328f.jpg" alt="20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can&#39;t hold it"><br>If there are Griffin and Ross, the pistons can respond in the third quarter, but it’s a bit worse. At the end of the third quarter, the Pistons’ counterattack was so weak, while the wizards were steady. Because of the advantages they gained in the third quarter, their mentality was very stable. Finally, the piston is unable to turn over.<br>Drummond scored 15 points, 24 rebounds, Kennard 24 points and wood 15 points. Apart from that, no other player can help Johnson to share the pressure.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can't hold it/8f77cb9d4eb54d8281c01be141e70435.jpg" alt="20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can&#39;t hold it"><br>In terms of the wizards, Bill scored 20 points and 6 assists, internal fierce general Bryant scored 14 points and 8 boards, and Japanese demon star bamura contributed 12 points. No one would have thought that the pistons would suffer such injuries in the new season, only to say that Griffin as the core of the team is really unstable. Griffin is an all star giant. Yes, he has a strong influence. But Griffin has always had a fatal weakness, that is, his body is too fragile. In the past few years, Griffin has become more and more outsider, from early violence to organizational vanguard.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can't hold it/e4058be04384420bad0dbe798d425e6d.jpg" alt="20 boards + 23 boards + 24 boards! The pistons fail. Griffinross, come back. Zhuang Shen can&#39;t hold it"><br>But that’s how Griffin can’t get rid of injuries, especially in the playoffs. When it comes to team injuries, Casey is frustrated: “when we lose a lot of points in our team, you have to improvise to let others shoulder the responsibility, and try to keep creativity to create attacking scoring opportunities. There’s no other way you can   “</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, thunder won two consecutive home games with a 102-94 victory over magic. Thunder’s recent form is really getting better and better, and today’s interior general Adams is back. Under the leadership of Chris Paul and Alexander, the thunder made a mercurial attack. Not only in the offensive end, thunder is also very tough in the defensive end, but also in the defense of Robson, the first gate, if Robson can return, thunder’s defense will be suffocating. Because Paul and Alexander can defend and are willing to defend.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year/4529dc6e27cd4b92b6a7554ae99f8f67.jpg" alt="24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year"><br>Today, thunder basically killed magic by defense. Thunder started well. Gallinari opened up the situation with a three-point shot from the outside line and Alexander also scored 2 points with the ball. Paul showed his overall view and the distribution of the ball was very reasonable. Thunder led 5 points 31-26 in the first quarter.<br>In the second quarter, the magic began to work. The combination of vucevic and Isaac was unstoppable. Once led the team against the thunder 1 point. But Paul came out at the critical moment, breaking through the basket to pick the blue and scoring two points. Alexander also made a free throw and made two free throws. Thunder regained its lead. Alexandre scored another 2 points in the middle at the end of the quarter, and the thunder hit a wave of 6-0 in the half and still led 5 points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year/1ea812b6fac042e6abb8f190e4ca9dd8.jpg" alt="24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year"><br>In the second half, the thunder took the lead, Gallinari shot, Adams also hit, the thunder hit 8-2. The difference will be opened to 10 points, but the number one Lang fultz explosive force, he cut 4 points in the sudden shooting. Vuchevic and amino also scored eight points. With Paul’s free throw and Noel’s under the basket, the thunder led by two points in the third quarter to the end. The score was 81-79.<br>Thunder began to dominate at the end of the day. Substitute general betzley hit another 2 points with 3 points and scored 5 points. Alexander also started the scoring mode, starting with a 2-point jumper and then a 3-point catch from the outside. The thunder made a wave, Paul also hit in the middle distance, thunder in the last minute leading 8 points, plus Paul hit 2 free throws to kill the game.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year/45a751770bc64e32ba97dd437d7e3582.jpg" alt="24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year"><br>In the whole game, all three giants contributed to the thunder. Alexander scored 24 points, Gallinari scored 16 points, and Paul scored 20 points and 6 points to help 3 steals. The comeback Adams scored 11 points and 11 boards, and Schroeder scored 5 points in 2 of 11. At present, the thunder has begun to improve their record. They rose to the 11th place in the West with a record of 3-4, and began to impact the playoffs.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year/6418855294fd41378e85c62d6b35463f.jpg" alt="24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year"><br>A lot of fans say thunder can’t make it to the playoffs under Paul’s leadership, but in fact, thunder’s strength is not bad. Alexandre and Gallinari, the two clippers, have excellent three-point ability to increase the team’s sense of space.<br>Paul’s physical condition is also improving, while Alexander’s is getting stronger. In addition, thunder is the top four defensive team in the whole league. Their average loss of points is only 102.8 points, ranking the fourth in the league. Unlike a team at the bottom of the defensive League, thunder still has excellent offensive and defensive standards, and their defense is suffocating.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year/9e61f487aede42efb823a31882c843b2.jpg" alt="24+20+16! Two wins in a row, fourth in the defensive League, Paul faces a team, delayed by one year"><br>In the past, Paul’s defense was delayed in a certain team, especially James Harden, who could only defend the center under the basket when he moved slowly. I can’t defend the little guard. I often need someone to wipe his ass. And Paul joined thunder, it’s obvious that he doesn’t need to wipe the bottom for others on the defensive side, that is, to guard his attacker. Look at the defense of weishao after joining a team. In the past few years, the thunder system has really made up for the weakness of weishao’s defense.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the heat won 129-100 at home. The heat played comfortably in this game. They basically spent the game in a single quarter. Let the game become the human purgatory of the opponent, from the beginning of the first quarter, the heat showed the horrible scoring ability. Adebayor’s dunk was good, and Butler’s lift on the outside line was a three-point hit. The heat have a 5-0 lead. After that, the heat did not give up, they again played a 21-2 offensive frenzy. Especially this year’s No. 13 rookie Hiro keeps scoring.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/0b7a9889f3b9498288268d158879f4d5.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>The heat pulled the difference straight to 24, just when all the fans thought the heat’s offensive was slowing down. They had another 10-0 run at the end of the quarter, when the difference had been extended to 32. The heat basically beat the game in a single quarter. But the heat don’t seem to be satisfied. They still want to abuse food and hate their opponents. So at the start of the second quarter, the heat had another 8-0 difference to 41.<br>Only after that did the opponents wake up like a dream. They started to fight back quickly and constantly approached the difference. But the heat can always respond, especially Leonard + Hiro + Robinson, who became the unstoppable General of the heat today. Butler also became the team leader at both ends of attack and defense. The heat were still 25 points ahead at half-time, 71-46.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/cfa9700b880a499c9df7650e69403cde.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>The heat scored 71 points in the first half, shooting 57.8%. It can be said that the heat’s attack is not too strong, but the opponent’s defense is too poor. In the second half, there was nothing to look forward to. The heat still played brilliantly and didn’t give the opponents any chance. Adebayor was down in the basket. Robinson hit three unreasonable points in a row, and the heat were still 28 points ahead at the end of the three quarters.<br>At the end of the season, the heat no longer gave the chance to let the substitute eat dumplings. The heat are again a wave of 14-0 to fight the opponent to the sky. Directly extend the difference to 40 points. In the end, the heat replaced the main force and let the substitute play at will. Butler couldn’t keep his mouth shut. James Harden and Westbrook left in dismay after the game.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/1c11bf71f9864fccbb9a617e204d9095.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>In the whole match, the three giants of the heat all contributed. Butler scored 18 points, 7 boards and 9 assists, Robinson 23 points and Leonard 21 points. The three of them are the great heroes of today’s team’s massacre of opponents. It has to be said that when Butler left the 76ers to enter the free market this summer, he did not choose to join the opposition but chose to join the heat, which is the right decision. Even with foresight, because from today’s game you can see that the heat is more tactical and more reasonable than a team.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/b00ae001bc9f45f880e5027a47de452b.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>If Butler joins a team, can he play comfortably? The whole game depends on one person holding the ball? What’s the point of being a star who doesn’t defend, and the tactic is to shoot three points dead? The defense is still poor, the team is not high enough, infatuated with the small man, if Butler really joined, it is really to mend the sky. Sometimes it’s hard to understand why Wes has to join such a team.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn't join them/e4ae58562ec746838b80801df6b4f315.jpg" alt="23+21+18! The big three went crazy. Harden left in frustration. Fortunately, Butler didn&#39;t join them"><br>If Wei doesn’t insist on going to the heat this summer, he will be more comfortable. After all, the heat’s tactics and configuration are more reasonable. Butler is also an excellent leader. He has both attack and defense. Especially in the defensive end are conscientious, and the key moment does not drop the chain. Last season when Butler was in the 76ers, but took the team and the Raptors to fight seven times, can only say that it’s a pity that weishao.</p>

    <title>24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/24,%2017,%2040%20+%205!%20Ingram%20is%20crazy.%20Who&#39;s%20the%20boss%20of%20pelican,%20and%20the%20suspense/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the pelican lost 125-135 to the nets. Ingram has undoubtedly become the most dazzling star in this game. He got 40 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 17-for-24 shooting and Owen is no inferior to Biao. From holding the ball under the basket, to a variety of mid-range hits, Ingram explained his offensive talent to everyone. It’s not just saying that he can be selected as the top one, but he has real talent. In the Lakers, due to Walton’s equalitarianism, Ingram’s data was not available. With Zion injured, Ingram got the boss’s privilege, and he finally fulfilled his talent to complete the explosion in the fourth year.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/ad50052096fe4f78b501340f6248e0e1.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>Today, both sides are in the process of hanging, but there is no doubt that the strength of the nets is stronger and better configuration, Pelican has been lagging behind. But under Ingram’s leadership, the pelicans continued to attack, but they were unable to support themselves. Pelican and the nets started today’s first quarter, where Allen scored two points under the basket, with prince and Harris scoring three points each. Holliday and Bauer on the pelican’s side also responded. After that Owen and Ingram got into a fight again. The net led 33-27 in the first quarter.<br>The second quarter of the net hit the attack wave, Jordan in the basket can not be stopped. The nets had a leadership advantage of 11 points. But Ingram once again became the God of death, he threw two unreasonable points in a row, and kept making free throws to kill and even the difference.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/0c6a40b677114669b04de82a9fc673af.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>Owen is not willing to be outdone, in Ingram fire, Owen also hit three-point response. The Nets’ two big players, left and temple, followed Owen closely, using two three points to put out the pelican’s counterattack momentum. And Owen also performed the same distance performance as Ingram at the end of the season, leading the nets to a half-time lead of 17 points.<br>In the second half, Pelican finally woke up, Ingram scored 2 + 1, Bauer also started the attack mode, a breakthrough with the ball scored 2 points, and then raised his hand outside the three-point line. Hart also came out and hit three points with Bauer again, Ingram was not weak, he also hit three points. In the pelican’s three-point rain, the advantage of the nets began to be eroded clean.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/937755f94987472fb13785e49a1065c8.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>The pelican scored 48 points in the third quarter, tracking the 17 point gap to 6 points, but the net’s substitute blew up in the last quarter. It was Temple who scored three points each with Ding Weidi, and the difference was widened to 11 points. Although Ingram and Redick scored crazily after that, and at one point the difference was close to 2 points, Owen + Harris + left killed the pelican at a crucial moment. In particular, Harris’s last-minute three-point death is really killing.<br>However, Ingram’s performance is amazing. It’s terrible to get 40 points in 17 of 24 shots. Even Durant at the top, right?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/4967fe37051646808c4ee2483049b54f.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>In addition, Owen is also excellent. He got 37 points, 9 assists and 3 steals in 13 of 21 games. Unfortunately, Ingram and Owen’s teammates are still quite poor. If Zion is still there, maybe the pelican has another fight. But there is no way that Zion is too fragile. Many people say that Zion is the leader of pelicans, but in the current situation, Ingram is the real emperor of pelicans.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who's the boss of pelican, and the suspense/c1ec395dfabd480f840a93b9e677e497.jpg" alt="24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy. Who&#39;s the boss of pelican, and the suspense"><br>It’s worth mentioning that when pelicans and Lakers started their negotiations, they didn’t want Ingram but Kuzma. And the Lakers don’t give it, for now. The pelicans are blessed with misfortune. They have a young Durant. Even if Zion comes back, he can only be an assistant. Ingram is 97 years old. He is only 22 years old and younger than some rookies.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/24, 17, 40 + 5! Ingram is crazy.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, clippers avenged jazz 105-94 at home. The Clippers really showed their tenacity to all the teams in this game. They were suppressed by jazz in the first three quarters, among which Leonard played iron in the first half. But at the critical moment, the clipper really can’t lose its chain. Leonard scored 18 points in the last quarter and finished the harvest again. It has to be said that Leonard is tough. The stronger he is at the critical moment, maybe this is the real superstar.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million/512d894a870942dc9c22c9764491d2e3.jpg" alt="3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million"><br>When Leonard and Paul George joined the Clippers this summer, many fans were worried. Are you worried that Leonard will destroy the clipper system and team basketball? Because the Clippers last season’s attack mercury diarrhea in general, especially the road and other players have possession of the ball? But it turns out that Leonard can connect every team seamlessly.<br>Because he doesn’t need to keep the ball in his hands like some superstars, he’s the end point. During the regular season, Leonard basically gave the ball to the backcourt. He could play as he liked. He was running in all kinds of positions, and then he ended it from time to time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million/4d8a5ba3266b4f8196ecb99c35fec18e.jpg" alt="3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million"><br>At other times Leonard was like a defensive blue collar man. He was dedicated to defense. A boss in the hand is not smooth, not to insist on indiscriminate shooting, but in defense to fill the offensive end. Then I believe in my teammates and dare to bear the responsibility at the critical moment. That’s the charm of superstars, and it can also drive the enthusiasm of my teammates. After all, when the boss works hard to defend, no one else dares to be lazy.<br>In addition, the clipper’s lineup is also extremely strong, they have many frontlines. Maybe last season Leonard didn’t end the warrior’s five small deaths, but the era of small balls. The current alliance is the era of frontline. Those with frontline will win the world. And the clippers have five fronts of death.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million/eb12aa31b9da47389aac4b3101d33030.jpg" alt="3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million"><br>The clippers have a line-up of 1 Leonard + 2 George + 3 green + 4 Patterson + 5 huckles, just like the divine operator Riley predicted. In the future, basketball will be a game composed of five frontiers. The more frontiers you have, the more chances you have to win the championship. Fmvp winners over the past few years have also shown the importance of frontline. Unlike a team of zatui defenders, Jerry West, the old man of clippers, has a fierce eye.<br>And Michael Green, an important part of the clipper’s front line, has an annual salary of only $4.76 million, less than $5 million.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million/48bf3ec2b635499c86088b78bad696ad.jpg" alt="3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million"><br>I’ve seen the Clippers. I know how good Jamie green is. He’s 2.06 meters tall. He’s very important to the Clippers in protecting the frame and rebounding. Green also has three-point range. In today’s game, green played 23 minutes and 52 seconds, the Clippers scored 30 points better than the jazz. Green’s 24 minutes and 08 seconds on the bench gave the Jazz 19 points over the Clippers.<br>That is to say, today’s green value is plus or minus 30. Today’s green is even more important to the Clippers than Leonard. He got 12 points, 6 rebounds, 1 assists and 1 block in 3-for-7 substitutions. Two out of five of three.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million/d310a9275329484ab05aaf224751cb06.jpg" alt="3 out of 7 cut 12 + 6, plus or minus value + 30 super small cards, clippers cheat, death five front only 5 million"><br>It is worth mentioning that Sir Jeff Green’s positive and negative value is - 26. Although both are called green, there is no doubt that the clipper’s green is stronger. This season, jerichael green can get 10.3 points and 4.9 rebounds in 20.9 minutes per game, with a hit rate of 53.4% and a three-point hit rate of 54.8%. He can hit 2.4 three points per game.<br>When he played warriors in the playoffs last season, Jamie green was brilliant and very good at fighting hard. It can only be said that the Clippers made money, only spent less than 5 million to win an important member of the five dead frontiers.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 9, 76 NBA regular season players visited Denver plateau to challenge nuggets. After the 76ers suffered two consecutive defeats, they lost general Simmons again. The continuous away games consumed a lot of money for the team, but also gave manager Brown more opportunities to try new methods. The Nuggets have won 2 consecutive games, but in fact, their overall condition this season is not good. Finally, after four quarters of fierce competition, nuggets to 100-97, once 21 points behind the situation, completed a surprise reversal.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost/4261bd9d76e143a0bafaacc52e95aaa8.jpg" alt="47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost"><br>The trend of the game was a little unexpected. I thought it would be a match between Jokic and the King Center of nbid, but they were not in good shape at the beginning of the game. Jokic has continued the Buddha system state of this season. He has not strong desire to attack. He has not high morale in the face of the same class of ebbed. In the first quarter, he made only one shot in four, mainly to plan for the team. But joachic’s performance also became the entire Nuggets team miniature, the first quarter end Nuggets only scored 18 points, behind 76 people 6 points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost/c06924459ac44899a8ace9f2ae568290.jpg" alt="47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost"><br>In the second quarter of the game, 76 substitutes began to score crazily, with three points for each hand, center o’quine got 11 points, 1 rebounds and 2 assists in a single quarter, Burke’s attack series also showed brilliant performance, while kokmazi scored three points in a row. In the first half, the 76ers scored 9 points and 3 points, with a hit rate of 75%. The Philadelphia substitute completely blew nuggets, and directly increased the difference to 15 points, which won enough rest time for the team’s starting.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost/e5847d16e3c74399ae9c59a07a227459.jpg" alt="47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost"><br>Yi Bian fought again, but Jokic still couldn’t find the feeling of the game, and Murray began to carry the Nuggets forward, he hit the middle distance in a row, with his own efforts to trace the difference to 6 points. However, with the 76 defensive strength increased, Nuggets attack power suddenly, seven consecutive games failed! The 76 people who had changed to shenlai took the initiative on the field again. After a wave of 3 minutes of rain, they led by 19 points with 84-65.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost/7465e351411a454eaf64f3fa3c380bd2.jpg" alt="47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost"><br>At the end of the final match, the situation on the field suddenly changed, and the Nuggets continued to improve the intensity of the game. Jokic also woke up like a dream, and became the omnipotent fat man, even three-point open. Denver Nuggets continued to play defensive counterattack, hit a wave of 27-9 offensive climax, wipe out the difference at one stroke. In the last 30 seconds, the 76ers took the lead with one point in hand, and held the ball right. However, three non stick pitches were made in hofford’s free space, while Jokic finished the kill shot, leaving only 1.2 seconds for the 76ers. However, Jokic’s last performance was not over yet, which then led to the offensive foul by enbid and the complete end of the game suspense.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost/3670e590468747de8c206dd49ba70439.jpg" alt="47 minutes ahead, killed in the last minute, the first center fight, and ebbed lost"><br>He scored 26 points, 11 rebounds, 6 assists, 2 steals, 2 blocks and made only one mistake. On the other hand, ebbed scored 19 points and 15 rebounds in only 6 of 17 shots, and sent out 8 mistakes. At the last moment, ebbed the team’s hope of winning. 76 people led 47 minutes, but failed in the last moment. Three consecutive defeats still show some problems of the team, and there is a lack of star players who can be determined at the critical moment.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Lakers beat the Spurs 103-96 away for five straight wins. After losing to Clippers at the beginning of the game, the Lakers didn’t lose a single game. It has to be said that they are too dominant. In particular, James and Davis after running in, now with great, and tacit understanding. In addition, the rise of Howard also brought about the transformation of the Lakers. In order to reduce McGrady’s time to reuse Warcraft, we can really see how terrible the best defender in the League used to be. Howard’s frame is too strong. If his bounce can improve with the depth of the season, then the Lakers will be even stronger.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners/b5b42f2e317c45bf9aa6c5bd1729a560.jpg" alt="7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born. The Lakers are the big winners"><br>Today’s game is also the process of the Lakers play freely, especially the ability to play hard. The Lakers are stronger than the Spurs, and the Spurs show the toughness of the old team. The Lakers pulled back several times, but the Spurs always responded. It’s like today’s first quarter. The Lakers are playing like a tiger. After the Spurs started 5-0, the Lakers kept fighting back. Green’s three-point hit, Bradley and James’ duet combined to score points in a row.<br>The Lakers directly overtook the Spurs, and James started a personal attack mode, scoring a tough 2 + 1. The rivalry between Davis and Aldridge was also a full-scale grind. Davis slammed from dunk, three points to center. The Lakers gradually spread the gap.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born.

The Lakers are the big winners"><br>Unfortunately, the Spurs are tough enough. Every time the Lakers pull the difference to 7, they always respond. In the first quarter, the Lakers were only 1 point ahead, and in the second quarter, the Spurs showed the spirit of immortal Xiaoqiang again. The combination of Murray and guy started with a 5-0 direct victory over the Lakers. But the Superman combination of James and Howard also began to work. James continued to score, and Howard also scored under the basket. The Lakers are 9-1.<br>It’s worth mentioning that Howard also showed his versatility in the game. He held the ball at a high position, saw Davis slip to the basket, and fed directly to Davis to complete the free catch. James is also happy not close mouth, Howard this pass has his style. In Howard’s performance at both ends of the attack and defense, the Lakers are braver and braver. James then had a backcourt pass to Bradley to score 2 + 1. Kuzma hit the outpost three points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born.

The Lakers are the big winners"><br>The Lakers led by 13 points 56-43 in the first half, and Davis became the main point of attack in the first half of the second half. He even got 4 points to extend the difference to 19 points. But the Spurs are the Spurs. Under such adversity, they still show what is team spirit. The combination of drozan and guy stands out and keeps chasing points. In particular, Gai Yong can not be when, at the end of the third quarter, the Spurs have the difference to 5 points.<br>At the end of the season, Murray, the first bootlicker in the Spurs, broke out. He scored 14 points in a row, helping the Spurs catch up to 90 in the last 4 minutes and 10 seconds! But the combination of James and Howard began to work again, James two assists pop scored five points in a row. Howard also put on a strong touch in an offensive round.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13! Give Davis some bread. All-around Howard is born.

Davis Cut 25 points, 11 boards, 4 hats and 6 hats.<br>Howard is a real eye opener. He got 14 points, 13 boards and 2 caps in 7 out of 20 minutes. It’s worth mentioning that today, McGrady only played 11 minutes, which seems to be a fake starter. Vogel should not want to let Howard play first, want to let him in the reserve as a strange soldier, just like the Clippers use Harrell.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/7 balls 14 + 13!

    <title>9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/9,%200,%2033,%2016!%20Thank%20you%20James%20for%20waking%20him%20up%20in%20time/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a regular season game that ended today, the Lakers beat the Spurs 103-96 for five straight wins. After losing to Clippers in the first game, the Lakers seem to be getting through Ren and Du. They are like a wild animal that starts to wake up and play at the top level of attack and defense. Today’s Spurs are tough. They once filled in the 19 point gap. If the average team is chased by spurs like this, it will eventually collapse because of the pressure. But the Lakers resisted all the pressure. There were three players who decided to play today, James + Howard + pop.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time/9a100d60b48542f9a561f7a97fad698b.jpg" alt="9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time"><br>James did not say much, the whole field again cut three pairs, 21 points 11 rebounds 13 assists 2 steals 1 block. Let’s focus on Howard and pop. Now the Lakers’ strongest opponents, clippers, are the substitutes of Harrell and luway, and the Lakers seem to have started to find their own substitutes. In the past few games, Howard and pop have become the “black impermanence team” of the Lakers. As long as they work hard, they can become the death of their opponents and take away their lives. At the end of the day, the Lakers relied on Howard and pop to break the Spurs’ final counterattack momentum.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time/d8b13cfebe3d4ddbadd60d0969bfec94.jpg" alt="9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time"><br>Howard played 21 minutes today, 7-for-7, 14 points, 13 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 covers. In the 28 minutes of pop’s game, he got 14 points, 1 rebounds and 1 steals from 5 of 9 shots. In terms of positive and negative values, Howard and pop are both + 14. It is worth mentioning that. Popper did badly in the first two games.<br>At that time, pop was very depressed because he was criticized by Lakers fans. The fans in Los Angeles are tough we all know, and James told pop. You need to ignore the outside voice and show yourself with action. Popper also revealed at that time that he learned from James to block all the criticism from the outside world, and he did not use the Internet.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time/6795d8587e584749aa3e1fbbad274799.jpg" alt="9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time"><br>In a word, today’s brave performance of pop, he may not know how to blow him on the Internet, which is a very good state. James wakes pop up with words and asks him to prove everything with action. And Pope did. In the Lakers’ first two games of the season, Pope made a total of 9-0 shots, shooting 0% and scoring only 1 point.<br>After shielding the outside voice to concentrate on playing, Pope made 33 shots in four games, and hit 16 of them, 39 points in total, with a hit rate of 48.4%.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time/2b3b989867f3423c99e3af2183a7c832.jpg" alt="9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time"><br>That’s good news for the Lakers. They need pop and Howard to show themselves in the second team. Some fans say why didn’t Vogel let Howard play in the first place? And let McGee fight? In fact, Vogel has his own plan, because it is more beneficial for him to let Howard play as a substitute, and it can also reduce his injury.<br>What’s more, today McGrady only played 11 minutes. In the final analysis, McGrady has become a fake starter. It’s not that important whether Howard plays first or not, because he’s been treated as a starter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time/2b1f7450f9444d549438099e26b72a13.jpg" alt="9, 0, 33, 16! Thank you James for waking him up in time"><br>And Howard played as a substitute, James and Davis are also very satisfied, today both praised Howard’s performance in the defensive end after the game. Howard averaged 21.3 minutes this season, with 6.8 points, 8.2 boards, 1.3 assists and 2.33 blocks, with a hit rate of 79.2%, the highest in the league.<br>Doesn’t that mean that Vogel’s use of Howard is more reasonable? While reducing Howard’s injury, let him play as efficiently as possible. Vogel is really good.</p>

In addition to Alexander, thunder rookie Darius bezley also talked about Paul after the game. Bezley thinks Paul is really strict and has been criticized by him, but these are good things.<br>“In the last game, before the coach came in, Paul told me in the dressing room that he said there was a reason for passing the ball to me. If I didn’t dare to take a shot, he would not pass the ball to me. Paul asked me to keep on shooting. It doesn’t matter whether I hit 30 or lost 30. I’ve written that down, and today I’m very confident to shoot  . “<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/After being criticized in public by Paul before the game, bezli publicly thanked him/ae3c2f268bf545dcb1d6afc9173308c2.jpg" alt="After being criticized in public by Paul before the game, bezli publicly thanked him"><br>In the past few seasons, the quality of thunder shooter is not good, but this summer has been improved. Alexandre and Gallinari are good at three points. Now let Paul improve the team’s strength and cultivate Alexandre as the core of the team. Paul has done a perfect job. It’s the end Donovan wants to see. Thunder needs space. If they can make it to the end of the season, it’s not impossible to reach the playoffs. After all, Robertson hasn’t returned.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/After being criticized in public by Paul before the game, bezli publicly thanked him/50a1041196fe44c29947b7071e60bd40.jpg" alt="After being criticized in public by Paul before the game, bezli publicly thanked him"></p>

From the whole game, Ingram is more relaxed than Owen in scoring, especially his Durant style shooting is very surprised, it can be called a “no solution” shot.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/A 2.01, a 2.08, Durant and Ingram finally took a picture, 7 cm difference/4721653726a2411b96309db849001c80.jpg" alt="A 2.01, a 2.08, Durant and Ingram finally took a picture, 7 cm difference"><br>Durant also hugged Ingram after the game, just taking photos. Careful fans have found that Ingram’s height is not right. Ingram gave an official height of 2.06 meters when he was in the Lakers, while the pelican’s latest height was just 2.01 meters because the League let the team report the height of naked feet.<br>Compared with the Lakers, Ingram was 5 cm shorter at 2.06 meters, but today we can see that Ingram’s height in the group photo is similar to Durant’s, a little shorter, which is not very obvious.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/A 2.01, a 2.08, Durant and Ingram finally took a picture, 7 cm difference/02ae0137fbe746c48741c3165ce303e9.jpg" alt="A 2.01, a 2.08, Durant and Ingram finally took a picture, 7 cm difference"><br>Durant’s latest barefoot height is 2.08m, one is 2.01M, one is 2.08m, that is to say, after wearing shoes. Ingram should be 2.03 meters tall, while Durant is 2.10 meters tall. But in the latest photo, where is the height difference between Ingram and Durant? 7 cm?<br>We don’t know how the pelican measures it? What’s wrong with that? Did they let Ingram hunchback to measure his height? From the perspective of the game, Ingram is not like a 2.01-meter forward. He is taller than Bauer and hollerdy and Zion. Zion barefoot is 1.98M, Bauer is 1.98M.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/A 2.01, a 2.08, Durant and Ingram finally took a picture, 7 cm difference/275d31486e2e4ac093274b8526278c8d.jpg" alt="A 2.01, a 2.08, Durant and Ingram finally took a picture, 7 cm difference"><br>In addition, when James and Ingram are in the Lakers, we can also see that Ingram is higher than James. James’s latest official barefoot height is 2.06 meters, 3 centimeters higher than the rookie’s 2.03 meters. If Ingram is 2.01 meters tall, he should be shorter than Durant and James.<br>Now he’s taller than James, almost like Durant. I can only say that pelican’s measurement is not professional.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/A 2.01, a 2.08, Durant and Ingram finally took a picture, 7 cm difference/119903566a624912b0dd0bdbc2f5b694.jpg" alt="A 2.01, a 2.08, Durant and Ingram finally took a picture, 7 cm difference"><br>The advantage of Ingram is Durant’s advantage. He is tall and has long arms. When he shoots, almost no one can cover him. In terms of today’s game, Ingram was really high when he shot, and the defenders couldn’t stop him at all.</p>

    <title>Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game yesterday, the Lakers beat the Spurs for five straight wins. In that game, Lakers substitute Howard played a hot performance again, he got 14 points, 13 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 blocks in 7-for-7 of the game. Howard dominates the court at both ends of attack and defense. It can be said that Howard’s rise is the key to the Lakers’ five consecutive wins.<br>How many times when the Lakers are on the brink of extinction, Howard has become a wonder soldier. Without Howard but relying on McGrady, the Lakers can’t win five consecutive games. This is the influence of the former superstar and the best defender in the league. The so-called skinny camel is bigger than the horse.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/476e140cd8c040d2b80e59f52c2d1383.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>According to the statistics of NBA official website, Howard’s direct bonus to the Lakers is not hidden data, but real data to reflect Howard’s influence. Although he is a substitute, but the performance has run over the starting McGrady. So far, when Howard is on the court, the Lakers’ attack efficiency (i.e. 100 round score) is 115.7 points, and defense efficiency (100 round score) is 90.4 points, ranking first in the league, with a net efficiency of 25.3 points.<br>And when Howard was not there, McGee picked up position five. The Lakers’ offense efficiency dropped to 97.3, defense efficiency to 98.9, and net efficiency to - 1.6.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/21dc5de090124b59957b24e64da7ab69.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>That’s the difference between playing and playing. Howard can give the Lakers a + 26.9 attack and defense efficiency bonus. It’s a terrible number. Howard’s bonus on the Lakers’ bench is the first, even better than the starting line-up. What’s more surprising is that Howard’s physical condition is still recovering. He’s better than one game at a time. In the preseason, Howard’s bounce was a little bit worse and he didn’t move enough.<br>As the game progressed, Howard’s bounce began to recover and his movement became faster. Now he can not only top defense under the basket, but also prevent the small guard to complete the steal.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/d578ba85d35a467483641191d2b3c7a0.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>So far this season, Howard has contributed 6.8 points and 8.2 rebounds per game, of which the shooting percentage is an astonishing 79.2%, the highest in the League at present. Howard’s integration also makes the atmosphere of the Lakers very wonderful. Today, Davis also talked about the current situation of the Lakers. Bushmei is very satisfied here. It seems that next year’s extension of the Lakers will not be a problem.<br>Davis played at will with the Lakers, and compared to the preseason and opening regular season openers. In the past five games, the brow has become more and more relaxed, and Howard and pop are back in their combination. They are like the combination of the Clippers’ Harrell and the rookie.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/bda0357de1e844f697991b38213dedd8.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>When talking about his relationship with LeBron James, Davis also made public that he thought his relationship with James could not be called brother, but just like glue. Davis also said that James named their relationship “peanut butter banana sandwich.”<br>Davis said: “  I was traded by the pelicans this summer, and I didn’t spend much time training with LeBron. But I didn’t expect that we would be so tacit. We are like natural partners. LeBron once said to me, “we’re not peanut butter and jam sandwiches yet. We’re like peanut butter and banana sandwiches, but we can get better!”<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard's two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James/7d6b94de446c445a9befa9806ddc3226.jpg" alt="Attack and defense efficiency + 26.9! Howard&#39;s two big data came first, and Davis also showdown James"><br>Peanut butter banana sandwich  , it’s obvious that James still thinks that he and Davis haven’t cooperated to the same extent as he and Wade. Since both Wade and James have said that their relationship is like a peanut butter and jam sandwich, the next step for James and Davis is to turn the peanut butter and banana sandwich into a peanut butter and jam sandwich.</p>

It has to be said that their condition is also starting to pick up. Before that, coach Walton was under a lot of pressure. I can’t keep my job if I lose. But today, the king’s players also gave their strength, especially the three giants Barnes + Hilde + Fawkes did very well. They defended the dignity of the coach. At first, Walton was ready to leave class, but the three of them made Walton hope again. Maybe the king could save even better.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points!

Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic"><br>Today, the king showed his desire to attack from the first quarter. After Morris and Randall led the Knicks to a strong start, the king who found his hand began to fight back. Hilde was unstoppable, scoring 10 points in a row from the outside three to the under basket attack. Fox also continued to attack the Knicks with a sudden penalty, berecha and Ariza also hit long-range shots respectively. King has already surpassed Knicks in the first quarter and gained an 11 point lead.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points!

Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic"><br>In the second quarter, the king tried again. They didn’t give Nix any possibility of chasing points. Under the leadership of Holmes and Barnes, the King opened the second quarter with 11-0 difference to more than 20 points. Although the Knicks kept chasing points in the half, the king always responded, so the king still led by 20 points, 61-41.<br>In the third quarter, the king played three crazy, fox + Hilde + Barnes three giants at the same time, one three-point goal in one. The king started a three-point rain, and directly opened the difference to 32 points. After Barnes hit the scoring again and again, fox hit frequently. Don’t fight at the end. Nix disarms and surrenders.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points!

In addition, forward Holmes scored 14 points and 10 boards, and center Boris berecha also got 10 points, 8 boards and 6 assists. Nick’s long Barrett scored 22 points and couldn’t get back to the sky.<br>At the end of today’s game, when the king’s first break came into the garbage time, the camera swept to the king’s bench. At that time, Walton was smiling, and he really felt relieved.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points!

Welcome to the second consecutive win, Walton secretly smiled after the game, which made the West more chaotic"><br>As some netizens have said: Walton has packed his bags, Fox and Hilde have brought them back alive, Barnes has closed the door, holding his legs.<br>It can be said that it was the king’s big three that saved Walton today. They let the young manager stay. It’s just that for the west, the rise of the king has made it even more chaotic. In the last game, the king beat the strong jazz, which killed the Knicks. It’s a good omen. After all, last season, King almost made it to the playoffs, but in the end, he was a little bit worse, but he can also make it to the playoffs in the East.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Big three 65 points!

Fox also befriended Walton before today’s game: “we will support him. He has been doing well since he came here. We trust him and he trusts us</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Golden State Warriors narrowly beat the Blazers 125-116. In this game, all five-star warriors were absent, Thompson continued to reimburse, Curie kept fit for three months, Green’s finger ligament was suspended, and Russell also hung a high exemption card. Rooney couldn’t make it back. It can be said that warriors basically all the core has fallen, but they still created a miracle. Winning the Blazers who are in the limelight recently, we have to say that the warriors are the Blazers who eat, sleep and play. This year’s playoffs hang up. I didn’t expect the warriors to let the first five tigers, or to break the Blazers, it’s really hard.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Bang 36+13! The second round of the warriors was bombed again. Cole sniggered. Russell could be the audience/2effaaffbe034b1c805ca5db76073072.jpg" alt="Bang 36+13! The second round of the warriors was bombed again. Cole sniggered. Russell could be the audience"><br>Today, the Warriors also showed a strong desire to attack. From the first quarter, the warriors launched a fierce attack. Especially this year’s second round rookie Pascal, he hit three points in a row, Robinson and Bowman also started scoring mode, they each scored a middle distance. Warriors start 14-7. Lillard is not in a hurry, he first assists the big white side basket, and then Lillard himself also hits the basket for layup. The Blazers are closing in on the difference. At the end of the quarter, the warriors’ substitutes, Spelman and Blazers’ substitutes, hyzonia, soared three points each other.<br>In the first quarter, the warriors led by 2 points with 34-32, and in the second quarter, both sides attacked and defended each other. The combination of Lillard and mccollham helped the Blazers regain the lead in the half, ending the half 63-60.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Bang 36+13! The second round of the warriors was bombed again. Cole sniggered. Russell could be the audience/4427e0305fbb4c25ac80a4bf65c6dc5f.jpg" alt="Bang 36+13! The second round of the warriors was bombed again. Cole sniggered. Russell could be the audience"><br>In the second half, the warriors still relied on Pascal. He kept scoring, especially a very elegant mid shot. Under his leadership, the warriors started 8-0 to surpass the Blazers by three points. Lillard and dabaibian do the same as long as they are in adversity. Their combination of one inside and one outside can always break out, Whiteside’s under the basket hook hit, Lillard three points into.<br>Pascal broke out again when the warriors were in trouble. He started with a mid-range shot and then made a strong make-up under the basket. In the third quarter, the warriors overtook the score 87-83.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Bang 36+13!

Kuri’s brother-in-law Damian Lee shot in, Pascal three points into, Bauman fast break into two points, Chris in the basket from the strong make-up. Warriors were 12 points ahead in the last four minutes, and while hyzonia hit a couple of three points, the Blazers couldn’t turn the tables.<br>In terms of data, Lillard scored 39 points and was unable to save, McCollam scored 14 points and 6 assists, and Whiteside scored 22 points and 11 rebounds and 2 blocks. The hero of warriors is undoubtedly Pascal, who shot 36 points, 13 rebounds, 1 block and 19 times hit 11 goals.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Bang 36+13!

Birthday effect warrior country! “<br>As a second round rookie, Pascal has undoubtedly become the biggest harvest of the warriors. Even if they can’t make it to the playoffs this year, the warriors have at least got a future core. After all, the second round rookie warriors have found treasure. For example, Drummond green is the second round rookie, and finally becomes a giant.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Bang 36+13! The second round of the warriors was bombed again.

In the past two games, Pascal has scored 25 + 4 and 36 + 13 respectively, and he has scored 61 + 17 in both games.<br>Pascal can get a 17 + 4 + 1 shooting rate of 60.3% in 29.4 minutes per game this season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Bang 36+13!

    <title>Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach&#39;s order again, and Malone made another request after the game</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/Boom%2020%20+%207%20+%204!%20Jokic%20disobeyed%20the%20coach&#39;s%20order%20again,%20and%20Malone%20made%20another%20request%20after%20the%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, Denver won 91-87 away from magic! This game magic let the champion Lang fultz play the first place, but did not have a particularly eye-catching performance. The Nuggets won by rowing. The gap between the two sides is still quite large. After all, Nuggets reached the second round of the playoffs last season and almost reached the Western Conference finals. Although the new season Nuggets record is not as brave as last year’s start, but also made 4-2 record.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach's order again, and Malone made another request after the game/593f10d00afd4ea2a33baf8bfbce69bb.jpg" alt="Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach&#39;s order again, and Malone made another request after the game"><br>Today’s game Nuggets also reached the state of free play. They didn’t start well, but the late starters won the magic. At the beginning of the first quarter, magic showed a strong aggressiveness. Vucevic scored 2 points in the jump shot, and then joined hands with Gordon to attack several times. Magic got a nine point lead in the first quarter.<br>In the second quarter, Denver Nuggets were still playing slowly. Jokic was still in charge of team-mates, and Denver Nuggets did not feel good. Magic was no better than where to go. Both sides fought iron so frequently. The only highlight was that fultz’s 2 + 1 showed his physical state. The Nuggets scored five points in the half and four in the second quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach's order again, and Malone made another request after the game/3adcb80679ac4302992e73ca73ce0a82.jpg" alt="Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach&#39;s order again, and Malone made another request after the game"><br>In the third quarter, Nuggets finally began to break out, while jokki + Millsap + Murray broke out at the same time, Nuggets hit a wave of 7-0 to complete the anti super. After Murray’s three quarters of attacks, Nuggets scored 69-63 points. At the end of the game, the two sides fell into the iron fight again. Ross of magic here scored 4 points, so Maurice even got 5 points to respond. The Nuggets are still five points ahead at the last minute and a half! Although fultz scored 2 points in the final layup, Nuggets still had a 4-point lead. In the end, Murray made two free throws in the penalty shoot out and nuggets took the game.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach's order again, and Malone made another request after the game/cd7d1d537ccc4cac990c2fb1edea7eff.jpg" alt="Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach&#39;s order again, and Malone made another request after the game"><br>In the whole game, Jokic was still all-around. He made 7 of 14 shots in 31 minutes and got the data of 20 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists. In addition, Harris scored 13 points, Murray 22 points. Although Nuggets won, but there is a pity that Jokic still did not listen to the coach. Before today’s game, Coach Malone repeatedly told Jokic to increase his aggressiveness and make at least 15 shots. However, he didn’t follow Malone’s instructions. Today, he only made 14 moves. And 14 shots are the sum of the past two.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach's order again, and Malone made another request after the game/2cae2e3c25dd41edb37ab134ec8debd2.jpg" alt="Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach&#39;s order again, and Malone made another request after the game"><br>It can be seen from here that Jokic is really unselfish. He often gives the ball to his teammates. Because he didn’t want to become James Harden, a game of crazy shots, the ball right in their hands so that teammates simply can’t deal with the ball also hit the field enthusiasm. Of course, we all know that there are two sides to Jokic’s inaction.<br>First: don’t want to hit the enthusiasm of teammates because of his own shot, second: Jokic is also lazy to shoot. He has little interest in unlimited firing power. But Malone is not ready to let him go. After the game, he asked again, hoping that he could do more.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach's order again, and Malone made another request after the game/1a06396ca2244456a3b53b802249c330.jpg" alt="Boom 20 + 7 + 4! Jokic disobeyed the coach&#39;s order again, and Malone made another request after the game"><br>Malone said: “Jokic is very clear that we have talked about this topic, about the hand. I hope that Jokic will be more aggressive and more aggressive. But you know he’s too smart, he knows he needs to be more aggressive, but he still plays in the right way. He said to me, “you need me to be more aggressive, but I also need to play in the right way.”<br>Malone’s comments on Jokic are clear, but he hopes that he will make 15 shots per game. But it’s clear that he doesn’t want to comply. If he makes too many shots, he will feel that he is not playing in the right way. When Jokic will also increase his hand in specific occasions, all the situations on the court will be seen.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles Lakers won. They beat the bulls on the road today. This game LeBron James again played a frightening number. 35 minutes on the court, 19 shots 10, 30 points 10 rebounds 11 assists, completed the 84th triple double of my career. It has to be said that James, 34 and 35, is still at the top of his career. Compared with his brother Chris Paul’s decline in thunder, the explosive power is not available at the age of 34. James still has the ability to break through at the top. The Lakers are currently at the top of the Western Conference, and it seems that the chances of hitting the championship are increasing.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma/226b009509b1413a91c65e961cc00361.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma"><br>The difference between the Lakers and last season is that their offensive and defensive standards have been greatly improved. If it’s the Lakers who are 17 points behind last season, it’s hard to reverse, because their defense is not strong enough. This season, the Lakers’ defense level has been greatly improved, relying on tough defense to grind, which laid the foundation for their victory.<br>What’s more, they have a stronger sense of space in attack than last season. Last season, the Lakers had a general defense and constipation in attack, which led to a sharp decline in James’ one star four shot system. In addition, James’ groin injury also affected his play. After the forced comeback, James’s explosive power was not available. The layup that can be completed before the injury could not be completed after the injury.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma/6a027f147b704a7ea1deb247721ad3c2.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma"><br>James had let it out in public a few days ago, and he will never be forced to come back in the new season without recovering from his injury. This not only affected the team, but also made him questioned. James said that his groin was still torn when he came back last season. Today, when James talked about the groin, he specifically mentioned Kuzma.<br>Because this season Kuzma also suffered some injuries, although not as heavy as James. But it also affected Kuzma’s performance. When James talked about Kuzma, he asked him to be cautious about injuries.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma/69523a74376c48bab7b1698b97d5c413.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma"><br>James said: “Kuzma is not what we know today. His rhythm is different from last season. He looked a little slower, and in the first half he was a bit edgy. There have been some mistakes, of course we can’t expect him to recover completely in one or two games. Because I had a groin injury last season and I was a bit impatient after coming back, it will take a while for Kuzma to get used to it<br>James’s meaning is self-evident. Kuzma should take it easy. Don’t be too impatient. Sometimes young people are too angry. Now they should wake up like a dream.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma/6ed11a5f26944f788113aec3dd95680b.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma"><br>Of course, some fans in the groin may not know what it is. Groin is an important part connecting abdomen and thigh. Being close to James, he is often regarded as a part of privacy. The wetness and airtightness of the groin often become a health risk.<br>Groin is a very sensitive part. Once injured in this area, it can only be raised slowly and cannot be recovered quickly. Any stretching action will be accompanied by great pain. So it was a mistake for James to make a forced comeback last season. Stephen curry also told James that if he made a forced comeback with a groin injury, he would lose more than gain.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma/4642ad9fdad84c408be6e0c78e54570a.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 11! James referred to the groin opening to vent and made a request to Kuzma"><br>The good thing is, although the groin injury is troublesome, it is not a big injury but a small one, just a more troublesome one. However, once fully recovered, it will be recovered without any hidden danger.</p>

    <title>Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It&#39;s not your fault, Wiggins. It&#39;s alphabet brother. He&#39;s going to take MVP again</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/Boom%2034%20+%2015%20+%206!%20It&#39;s%20not%20your%20fault,%20Wiggins.%20It&#39;s%20alphabet%20brother.%20He&#39;s%20going%20to%20take%20MVP%20again/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Bucks beat the Timberwolves 134-106. The Timberwolves’ cornerstone, Downes, continued to be absent from the game after a fight with enbid led to a league ban. But he is better than his teammates. Even if he doesn’t play in the four-star team, he still leads the team to win. The team has a better depth. But the Timberwolves don’t want Downes to sit on the inside. In the last game, the inside line of the main wizards won by Timberwolves was not strong. Coupled with the outbreak of Wiggins, Covington and Teague also gave support. Today, facing the full population of bucks, Wiggins is just a tree.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It's not your fault, Wiggins. It's alphabet brother. He's going to take MVP again/990371db24b6499bbf87c431ba647bec.jpg" alt="Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It&#39;s not your fault, Wiggins. It&#39;s alphabet brother. He&#39;s going to take MVP again"><br>Wiggins played 30 minutes in the game, scoring 25 points and 3 rebounds, shooting 10 out of 21. Four out of seven in three. Alphabet brother, on the other hand, scored 34 points, 15 rebounds and 6 assists in 26 minutes, shooting 14 out of 19 and 0 out of 3. Today’s game, the Timberwolves and the bucks on the standoff half-time.<br>In the first half at Wiggins and Covington, the Timberwolves played back and forth with the bucks. The Bucks didn’t open their three-point feeling in the first half, but we all know the advantages of bucks. They are not only the impact of brother Letterman, but also their outside shooters are excellent. So half-time bucks led Minnesota by 64-57 points, but also just a small fight.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It's not your fault, Wiggins. It's alphabet brother. He's going to take MVP again/46b71f7ec7ff42d9a683acfbd3155962.jpg" alt="Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It&#39;s not your fault, Wiggins. It&#39;s alphabet brother. He&#39;s going to take MVP again"><br>In the second half, the Bucks fought back. They hit 38-25 terrorist attacks in a single quarter. At the end of the third quarter, the Bucks were 20 points ahead. Among them, devinchenzo + Hill + Matthews + Middleton all shot. At the end of the day, it’s basically garbage time. It’s very easy to punch in and out of work in the third quarter. Wiggins also sat down in the last few minutes, his face was not willing.<br>In today’s match between Wiggins and alphanum, it is obvious that alphanum is more horizontal, and his teammates are better than Wiggins. A 34 + 15, a 25 + 3, Wiggins although has thrown away the medlar thermos cup, but still can not win the letter brother, this is the gap between the two. I have to say that brother alphabet is going to rob MVP again, and he would like to finish the cicada.</p>

He&#39;s going to take MVP again"><br>At the end of the third quarter, he was 20 points ahead of the Timberwolves. Basic competition<br>In the whole game, adelto combo got 34 points, 15 rebounds and 6 assists, Middleton scored 26 points, bradso 22 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists, and devinchenzo 17 points and 7 rebounds became today’s backup tough. Forest wolf’s Wiggins got 25 points, 2 blocks, Covington 15 points, Geon 10 points, tiger and warriors old Baihe cut 22 points.<br>At present, the Timberwolves are 4-2. They need to regroup and keep the edge until Downes comes back. After all, the Timberwolves want to make it to the playoffs this year. They need to work harder.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It's not your fault, Wiggins. It's alphabet brother. He's going to take MVP again/9de20b681fbe4f9d977a904efa29ed94.jpg" alt="Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It&#39;s not your fault, Wiggins. It&#39;s alphabet brother. He&#39;s going to take MVP again"><br>The good news is that Wiggins is waking up. In the past few seasons, Wiggins has never looked like this season, with murderous eyes. He’s abandoning the health basketball of the past, and that’s what Wiggins says. As the Timberwolves boss said, Wiggins has promised him that he will find himself and fulfill his talent in the new season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It's not your fault, Wiggins. It's alphabet brother. He's going to take MVP again/b06823c7f3d9495392bdaacba7edcbb6.jpg" alt="Boom 34 + 15 + 6! It&#39;s not your fault, Wiggins. It&#39;s alphabet brother. He&#39;s going to take MVP again"><br>Downes, like Wiggins, gave up health basketball. This season, Downes has not only made progress in the offensive end, but also greatly improved in the defensive end. Although the west is in a mess this year, the Timberwolves are not without a chance to enter the playoffs.</p>

    <title>Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/Boom%2021%20+%2010%20+%207!%20Rubio%20is%20crazy%20again.%20The%20Lakers%20need%20to%20be%20careful.%20The%20fish%20belly%20will%20be%20the%20first%20in%20the%20West/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Suns beat the 76ers 114-109 at home in a match that ended today. In the absence of ebbed, the invincible body of the 76ers was broken by the sun. The current record is 5-1 and the last winning team of the season is over. After the Suns won the game, they have won three in a row. The Suns, 5-2 this season, have finished second in the Western Conference and are now catching up with the No. 1 Los Angeles Lakers. I have to say that the sun is strong enough, especially the arrival of Rubio. He liberated the scoring machine, little kobibuk.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/90a49acf803b4b2395d5ee2ccc397275.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>Today, the Suns are not only good at the offensive end, but also good at the defensive end. They seem to have changed from a fish belly team to a championship team, all kinds of tactics are orderly. At the beginning of the first quarter, the Suns played against the 76ers, where Simmons slammed the basket and scored, while Harris and hofford scored five points in a row. Suns side basket’s big general Baines also obtains 4 points in a row, afterward he also in three points. After the first battle, the 76ers are only one point ahead.<br>In the second quarter, both sides felt bad, but they showed the intensity of playoff level at the defensive end. Rubio became the sun’s commander, under his command, the sun in the second quarter against the attack of 76 people, excellent defensive performance. The 76ers were only six points ahead at half-time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/2ac9718b137443afb1a10ee368650cea.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>In the second half, the sun launched a fierce attack, Booker opened the mode of big kill. He scored 11 points in a row, and all weapons from breakthrough to three points to middle distance were taken out. The sun was constantly approaching the differential. After the three points hit by ubre, the sun once drew up the differential. But top paid Mr. Harris worked hard. He scored 2 + 1 in one attack, then lay up again. Help the 76ers lead 1 point in the third quarter to the end.<br>In the fourth quarter, the sun erupted in an all-round way. They started 12-5, but they actually exceeded 76 by 7 points. After his last shoot out, kokmazi came out again today in adversity. He hit two threes to help the 76ers draw the difference again. But the sun side Booker and Rubio’s also got 4 points to respond.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/07a45ba4d9044021871b358b92bc6c40.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>The Suns took the lead by six points in the last minute, although hofford’s three-point shot raised hopes for the 76ers. But Burke and Rubio finished the harvest again. Booker grabbed a valuable rebounding, and two penalties, Rubio in the final second penalty to kill the suspense of the game.<br>In the whole game, there is no sense of Simons on the 76ers’ side. Basically, it’s just Horford + Harris. Today, Horford scored 32 points and Harris scored 24 points. There’s 20 points for kirkmaz. Simmons only got 6 points, 6 assists and 7 steals. Although Simmons is good at the defensive end and organization, his lack of attack power does affect the 76ers.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/22fbddeb1c634680a476c68a47e3fb31.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>On the contrary, when all four stars of the sun erupted, Booker scored 40 points with the help of Rubio. And Rubio also got the full data of 21 points, 7 boards and 10 AIDS. Baines, 15 points, 7 boards and 6 boards, helped carry the flag of Aton, and ubre also got 14 points, 6 boards. Now the sun is short of Aton. If he can agree to apply for reducing the suspension, then the sun will be terrible after Aton returns 1 Rubio + 2 buck + 3 ubre + 4 shakiri + 5 Aton, with strong competitiveness in the West<br>At present, the Lakers, 76ers and heat are tied for the first place in the league, 5-1. Obviously, it’s amazing that the sun can reach the second place in the West.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West/fc1cb3c9b7df49778833ee608d2905b1.jpg" alt="Boom 21 + 10 + 7! Rubio is crazy again. The Lakers need to be careful. The fish belly will be the first in the West"><br>In the past few seasons, the sun’s record can only be said to be poor, they rebuild year after year. Even though the Suns had Booker + ubre + Eaton last season, they still couldn’t make it to the playoffs, and their record continued to be at the bottom. And a deal from the Suns this summer has changed them, Rubio. He joined in six games to help the fish belly into the western second, Rubio can be said to let the sun a dead chess alive.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the pistons beat the nets 113-109 at home. After Owen killed a team with a magic ball yesterday, today’s back-to-back play against the pistons is really a little out of strength. Of course, the overall strength of the nets is still above the pistons. After all, the nets are full, Owen + Jordan + Harris + Dwight dinners and so on. And Griffin is still a truce. Even Derek cross is on a rotation, coach Casey has done a good job of taking care of Ross’s injury. But today, Drummond blew up again. In the whole game, Zhuang Shen got the horrible data of 25 points, 20 boards, 6 assists, 3 breaks and 5 hats.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 25 + 20 + 5!

No need to rob the rebounder"><br>Unfortunately, in the second quarter, the pistons lost power. They only got 13 points in a single quarter. In particular, the bench was suspended by the nets, and left and Ding Weidi, as well as Allen, the under basket bully, led the nets to play a 14-1 terrorist attack wave direct anti super score. Owen also scored six points in a row, with the pistons leading seven points in the first half to eight points behind.<br>In the second half, the nets continued to work. Prince didn’t make sense of three points in the outside company. The nets pulled the difference to 14 points. So far, piston’s big reversal script is finally open. Kennard, as the pioneer of pistons, frequently hit three points on the outside line, and Zhuang Shen also increased the aggressiveness under the basket. Two make ups. The pistons made a 20-2 attack. At the end of the third quarter from 14 points behind to 6 points ahead.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 25 + 20 + 5! Ross missed Zhuang Shen and blew up Owen.

No need to rob the rebounder"><br>Among them, Kennard scored 13 points in a single Festival, becoming a powerful helper beside Zhuang Shen today. At the end of the game, the pistons were even more brave. Meike made a mid-range shot, Mikhail Liuke scored three points, and piston one was 13 points ahead. Owen was just waking up when the nets were on the brink of extinction. He started killing God mode, hit 4 goals in a row, and helped the nets catch 2 points.<br>But at the last moment Kennard killed the net. He first threw the ball and scored, and then he got two free throws. The nets and pistons played the starting game at a crucial moment, but they looked down on Zhuang Shen, who made 3 of 4 free throws at the last minute. But the net this Ding Weidi and Prince two in a row take one.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 25 + 20 + 5! Ross missed Zhuang Shen and blew up Owen.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Raptors lost 105-115 away to the bucks. Even though the Raptors lost, they showed everyone their desire to win because they were 26 points behind. They almost created the biggest reversal of the new season. Unfortunately, the bucks are better at the last minute. But now the Raptors still make people feel that they are still in the ranks of championship. The strength they have, and the strong spirit and will in adversity, can only say that Leonard’s joining in a season really gives the Raptors the toughness they never had before.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 36 + 8!

Danger hit 26 points for the biggest reversal. Lori didn&#39;t lie this time. Raptors still have two cards"><br>The Bucks were really tired during today’s game. They were scared and sweated by the Raptors. It’s like remembering the fear of being beaten 4 times in a row 2-0 last season. From the beginning of the first quarter, the Bucks showed a good state. They wanted to kill the Raptors for revenge. The result is almost the same. The bucks are firing thousands of arrows. The letter elder brother’s impact, Middleton and blood cloth’s long-range casting. The Bucks started 12-1, while the Raptors were 0 out of 8.<br>But the Bucks didn’t let it go. Hill hit three more points, Lopez got in and alphanum continued to hit. The first stag is 19 points ahead.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 36 + 8!

The big Lopez hit three points in a row, the letter Goliath shot out. Cornwall also took the ball and scored three points, with the Bucks pulling the difference to 26. While the Raptors only rely on cicham dunk from time to time, and Gasol’s three points to stop the bleeding. The Raptors were still 16 points behind the bucks at half-time.<br>In the second half, raptors finally woke up like a dream, especially Lori opened the big kill and special kill magic. He scored 17 points and 3 assists in a single quarter, and cicham scored 10 points in a single quarter. The Raptors scored 40 points in a single quarter, and by the end of the third quarter, they were close to 5 points<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 36 + 8!

Danger hit 26 points for the biggest reversal. Lori didn&#39;t lie this time. Raptors still have two cards"><br>At the end of the day, Ibaka became the main character, when the Bucks pulled the difference to 10 points. Ibaka has a strong sense of presence on the defensive side and is still scoring 6 points on the offensive side. Help Raptors catch up to 96-100 by 4 points. After that, the two sides saw each other. The Raptors drew close to 4 points for many times, but they could not catch up with the score. At the end of the day, sikam made six more departures, while Pau Gasol lost the chance for the Raptors.<br>In the whole game, brother alphabet got 36 points, 15 boards, 8 assists and 4 caps from 14 of 20 shots, while Lori got 36 points and 6 assists from the Raptors, and the two men were even.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 36 + 8!

Danger hit 26 points for the biggest reversal. Lori didn&#39;t lie this time. Raptors still have two cards"><br>In terms of strength, raptors still seem to be in the top four in the East. They can compete with bucks + 76ers + Celtics. None of the four teams dare to say that I will win you in the playoffs. As Lori said, even without Leonard, Raptors are not being bullied, because their team is still at the top level. At the end of the day, the Raptors lost to the Cavaliers in the last few years. They were beaten by LeBron James and even had psychological problems. But they were not afraid to face other teams.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 36 + 8!

Raptors still have two cards"><br>After winning the title last season, raptors not only learned from Leonard, but also greatly improved their self-confidence. They are now called the championship team. In fact, after Leonard left, no one looked after the Raptors. So Raptors are just in a state of barefoot fear of wearing shoes.<br>We all think it’s normal if we don’t succeed in defending the title. If we win two titles in a row, then the Raptors will be like the sun in the sky, and they can blow. In fact, Leonard left Raptors is also in the general manager of ujeri’s plan. Raptors still have a base card, that is, West Kam and anunobi two frontlines.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 36 + 8! Danger hit 26 points for the biggest reversal.

Raptors still have two cards"><br>Cicam has grown a lot this season, has gradually become a superstar, anunobi has also filled Leonard’s position. If cicham and anunobi can continue to improve this season, Raptors are likely to reach the finals. If Raptors make it to the finals and Clippers make it to the finals, that’s what Leonard is looking forward to, because he still loves raptors and can’t play against a team he knows well.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, Celtic won the Cavaliers 119-113 away. Gordon Hayward has undoubtedly become the leading role in this game, and his performance against the Cavaliers is amazing. Heyward started the first quarter with a clean shot, breaking through from under the basket and getting into the middle. In the first quarter, he got 16 points, 2 boards, 2 assists and 0 mistakes in 7-for-7 shooting. All kinds of empty cuts were beautiful. Led by Hayward, Celtic led by 32-24 in the first quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 39 + 8 + 6! 130 million tycoons wake up to crack down on Lefu and hit all stars.

He hates Knights so much"><br>In the second quarter, both sides fell into the strangulation. Hayward + Walker + Tatum scored continuously here, and the combination of lesser NANs and Clarkson of the Knights over there also continued to attack. Loew and Thompson also started the scoring mode and made contributions. You come and I don’t give in, Celtic continue to lead Cavaliers by 9 points in the half.<br>In the second half, the Cavaliers started to fight back. They were close to the difference for a time, but Hayward came out to help Celtic stabilize their hearts. And Hayward can not only attack, but also drive his teammates. Hayward had seven assists in the first three quarters, and by the end of the three quarters, Hayward had 30 points and 7 assists.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 39 + 8 + 6! 130 million tycoons wake up to crack down on Lefu and hit all stars.

He hates Knights so much"><br>Although in the third quarter Celtic was knights to recover three points, but the last quarter Celtic hit a wave. Still led by Hayward, he scored three points at the end of the season and continued to lay up the basket, scoring nine points. He was brave. Celtic pulled the difference to 12 at one point, although the Cavaliers had nearly 3 points in the last minute. Lefo + Thompson + Osman + garland + Sexton five people work together.<br>But Celtic still won the game, and Heyward, he grabbed the last-minute rebound that could kill the game, and hit 2 points to kill the Cavaliers. In the whole game, Hayward scored 37 points, 8 assists and 6 rebounds in 17 of 20 shots. It was Celtic who won today.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 39 + 8 + 6! 130 million tycoons wake up to crack down on Lefu and hit all stars.

He hates Knights so much"><br>Two years later, Celtic won back the former all star with patience. Hayward left jazz in the summer of 17 and joined Celtic for $128 million in four years. Contract expires in summer 2021, player options 2020-21, 15% margin.<br>Unfortunately, Hayward was injured in only one game for Celtic in the 17-18 season. He broke his left ankle when he fell in a layup. Like Paul George, Hayward suffered a devastating injury. At the age of 29, the 90 year old finally regained his all star status in jazz.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 39 + 8 + 6! 130 million tycoons wake up to crack down on Lefu and hit all stars. He hates Knights so much/06f96f5629b549f1af12eb1c4efff8fa.jpg" alt="Boom 39 + 8 + 6! 130 million tycoons wake up to crack down on Lefu and hit all stars. He hates Knights so much"><br>Hayward averaged 18 + 7 + 4 this season, shooting 54.3% and shooting 47.6% in three points. Under Hayward’s performance, manager Stevens finally smiled.<br>In last season’s Celtic civil strife, Kyrie Owen and Rozier, as well as Tatum Jay brown and other fierce players can not be unified, all want to be the boss. As a result, the dressing room was in a mess and Hayward was affected. Because he was slow at the time, Stevens still gave him plenty of opportunities.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 39 + 8 + 6! 130 million tycoons wake up to crack down on Lefu and hit all stars.

He hates Knights so much"><br>Led to other people have opinions, but a season of patience finally let Hayward back, he is really hate Cleveland, affected his two seasons. I can only say that today Celtic win thanks to Hayward, this guy is too good.</p>

    <title>Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Grizzlies lost 100-107 at home. But this game grizzly’s top scorer Morant let people see the hope of Memphis rising. Morant has scored 23 points, 5 boards and 6 AIDS in 10 of 16 games. The 19 best point guard is fulfilling his talent and vowing to lead the Grizzlies back to the playoffs. And today’s game, the Grizzlies did their best.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie/cfe747912e154a79ae5365a4caf3376b.jpg" alt="Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie"><br>From the beginning of the first quarter, the two sides fell into a fight. Morant started the game with a strong shot and a good throw. After that, Morant once again took the ball to lay up and another player scored four points. Claude also hit three points to support Morant. The Grizzlies started the game strongly. But opponents Gordon and harden also kept scoring, their three-point arrows like rain. He beat the Grizzlies 14-4, 5 points behind in the first quarter.<br>In the second quarter, the Grizzlies began to work. Durant capocolo of Brazil was unstoppable. He completed the air contact and critical touch in an attack. Brooks also started scoring, with Grizzlies moving from 5 points behind to 2 points behind. But Brooks’s attack did not decrease. He scored seven points in a row. The Grizzlies were only two points behind in half time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie/656c4ccbe2a14bf8b00b68b37b17e516.jpg" alt="Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie"><br>In the second half, Morant started with a jump shot. Unfortunately, the combination of Hardon and Gordon kept scoring, especially the old king’s Mike Lemore, who was more successful outside the three-point line. The Grizzlies can only rely on kapokolo and Morant to maintain the difference. The Grizzlies were eight points behind in the third quarter.<br>At the end of the season, the two sides started to fight against each other. Here, kapokolo was able to smash the dunk. There, mcclemore scored another three points. Morant also scored 2 points with an inside cut and Gordon responded with a 3-pointer. In the end, the Grizzlies couldn’t get close to the difference. It’s a pity to lose the game. And with Westbrook out today, grizzlies shouldn’t have failed to win at home.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie/19badcb3317e43479d1d89a20bcafd54.jpg" alt="Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie"><br>In the whole game, Hardon scored 44 points, 10 boards and 6 assists. The Grizzlies have 23 points, 5 boards and 6 assists, Brooks has 17 points and 9 boards, Durant has 11 points, 5 rebounds and tile blue has 10 points and 10 rebounds. Klein has 8 points and 5 boards, Jones has 10 points and 5 boards, Anderson has 8 points and 5 boards.<br>In this year’s draft, with the exception of champion Lang Xi’an Williams, both the top spot and the explorer have now fulfilled their talents. Barrett was very fierce in the Knicks, but he drove a little higher and left a little lower. Morant, on the other hand, is driving low and walking high. He recently scored 20 points as if he were searching for something.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie/b4ca0ce1bfdf4c599fd1ed0ecde77b64.jpg" alt="Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie"><br>There must be some water at the top of the NBA’s history, for example, Zion may become a water product like Oden due to injury. Zion is less than 2 meters tall and weighs a terrifying 129 kg, which makes Zion’s knees suffer. We all know LeBron James is one of the strongest players in the league. But it’s better than James’ body. The frequent weight gain during the heat also leads to continuous injuries. Although there is no major injury, there are many minor injuries. After returning to Knight James gradually lost weight and became an iron man again.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie/369201f6c05547258d6f36c5a58ac219.jpg" alt="Boom 44 + 10 + 6! Weishao is absent from Hardon, and Morant is going to be the best rookie"><br>NBA’s history is really limited, and there are not a few rookies won by the point guard. In terms of Morant’s performance now, he is very promising to become the first person in 19 years, if Zion continues to suffer from such injuries. So the only thing that can compete with Morant is Barrett. With the bad atmosphere of Knicks, Morant is easier to grow in Grizzlies. This year’s best rookie Morant hopes a lot.</p>

    <title>Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth</title>
    <url>/2020/11/10/Breaking%20the%20fast%20ship%20and%20retreating%20the%20warrior,%20burning%2076%20people,%20the%20sun%20will%20not%20cut%20the%20unknown,%20Phoenix%20will%20complete%20Nirvana%20rebirth/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 5, the Suns of NBA regular season play the 76ers at home. In many people’s eyes, it’s a match with great power. After all, the 76ers have won 5 consecutive games. Even if enbeder is banned, they can’t stop them. In today’s NBA official list of team strength, 76 people remain at the top of the list, which is enough to illustrate the problem. However, the Suns are elite. They have defeated the warriors led by the clippers and Kuri before. They don’t kill the unknown. After four fierce battles, the Suns beat the 76ers 114-109!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth/d2436658eeac4debbfc50c787775329a.jpg" alt="Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth"><br>In this game, Sun Star Devon Booker’s hand burst. He started 32 minutes, made 15 of 19 shots, 3 of 3 points, 4 of 3, 7 of 7 free throws, and scored 40 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assists. It is worth mentioning that, after this game, the Suns’ record has reached 5-2, and because the Suns have beaten the Clippers before, they are superior to each other in terms of winning and losing, pushing the Clippers to rank the second in the west, which is the best start for the Suns since the 2013-14 season. In addition, the sun has only lost 2 points so far in the season, 95-96 to Utah and 107-108 to Denver.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth/6ffdbe814fa841ba9f1373c1cd52682d.jpg" alt="Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth"><br>Who says the sun can’t strike the west? This season’s sun has given us a fresh feeling. Although the champion Lang Aiton has been suspended for 25 games, they have finished Nirvana rebirth! After the arrival of Rubio, the attack of the whole suns has become very spiritual and hierarchical, not only relying on Booker alone, but also with more ball sharing and more running without ball. Up to now, the Suns have 28.3 assists per game, ranking second in the league, and third in the league in terms of net points per game. Their attack and defense efficiency is also the top ten level of the league.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth/40fec7444e5d4512bddd0c7c2741c9ee.jpg" alt="Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth"><br>All kinds of data show that it’s not a fluke that the Suns are second in the fierce competition in the West. They do have such ability. During the offseason, the Suns went through great changes. They signed Rubio and strengthened the No. 1 position which has been criticized. In order to make room for the renewal of ubre, they gave up their own Warren and also traded Saric. In addition, the sun also did a few less impressive operations, taking in control guard Javier Carter and hard line inside Baines.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth/5f03d9c318e448d4ba930114605c303c.jpg" alt="Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth"><br>All of these off-season operations have been successful at the start of the new season! With his own efforts, Aubrey proved the trust of the suns. He can contribute 17.4 points and 6 rebounds per game, becoming the Suns’ second point scorer and sharing the defensive pressure of Booker. Old guard Rubio enlivened the attack of the whole suns team, liberated Booker and made his scoring more efficient.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth/0c73039f4c19456f8bf36c013b232ab1.jpg" alt="Breaking the fast ship and retreating the warrior, burning 76 people, the sun will not cut the unknown, Phoenix will complete Nirvana rebirth"><br>And Baines is the unexpected joy of Aton’s competition. Baines, who was abandoned by the green army, has made great achievements under the system of Monty Williams. In the new season, he can contribute 15 points, 6 rebounds and 3.6 assists, with a three-point shooting rate of 48.4%, greatly opening up the space on the field. Moreover, his high-level strategy and screen quality are far higher than Aton, which is more suitable to partner with Booker. As for grizzly’s Carter, it improves sun’s defense efficiency! The overall improvement of both ends of attack and defense is an important reason for Suns to rank second in the west at present. Maybe they will have a place in the playoffs in the new season.</p>

    <title>Carrick&#39;s rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won&#39;t pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game ending at noon on October 31, the Jazz played against Clippers at home. Before the game, old rivers announced early that little card would take turns in today’s game. The purpose was simple. He would play Spurs tomorrow, and Leonard would be the leader. At the same time, old rivers also said that at present, the team has not decided how to solve Leonard’s rotation plan, but it must be considered in the future. 110-96, clippers lost to jazz on the road.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Carrick's rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won't pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs/e30abdd747f84bcdbc37f1e86b5cd3b2.jpg" alt="Carrick&#39;s rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won&#39;t pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs"><br>In terms of data, on the Jazz side, bergdan scored 14 points, gobel scored 13 points and 7 rebounds, Mitchell scored 24 points and 5 rebounds, Conley scored 29 points and 5 assists, and Ingels scored 10 points and 7 assists. On the Clippers side, Dewey has 24 points and 4 assists, Jamie Green has 23 points and 8 rebounds, and Harrell has 10 points and 2 rebounds.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Carrick's rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won't pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs/309f2e3e16b545cb9062f42a76e9c2a3.jpg" alt="Carrick&#39;s rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won&#39;t pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs"><br>Without Leonard, the Clippers may be a little weak. In the first quarter, the Clippers drove high and walked low. After Ludwig and zubates blossomed inside and outside, they fell into the strange circle of shooting and iron. Under the leadership of bergdan and Mitchell, the Jazz scored 13 points in a row. At the end of the quarter, they relied on Ingels and Jeff Green to surpass the score 25-10, 33-23 in a single quarter! In the second quarter, the Clippers gradually recovered their grip. Dewey made a continuous break into the basket to kill. Shamet’s free throw and Patterson’s three points. At the end of the first half, the clippers were only one point behind.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Carrick's rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won't pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs/1554286c9678470da40ec5b0803f87f4.jpg" alt="Carrick&#39;s rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won&#39;t pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs"><br>In the third quarter, the clipper was playing iron again. At this time, Conley broke out at the attack end, scoring three points, making a breakthrough of 2 + 1, playing board and throwing, and Mitchell and Bogdan scored three points in time. After a 29-6 wave, there was no suspense. At the end of the third quarter, the clipper was 71-90 behind the jazz. Throughout the fourth quarter, the Clippers also hit a wave of 13-2 climax, but finally Conley’s three points locked in the win, jazz ushered in three consecutive wins!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Carrick's rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won't pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs/c9110891e861487daa45f0ae5b272e9b.jpg" alt="Carrick&#39;s rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won&#39;t pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs"><br>For Conley, this game is the first outbreak of this season. In the past four games, Conley has only contributed 7.5 points per game, with the lowest efficiency value of the whole team. In today’s game, Conley ho scored 29 points in the face of the clipper’s defense, while Jazz are slowly on track after Conley’s recovery.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Carrick's rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won't pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs/2b830feb55ac44c3ad8db89520c913f6.jpg" alt="Carrick&#39;s rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won&#39;t pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs"><br>Lose the game, it’s OK. Make sure he’s completely healthy! According to Mingji Nicholas, the league has approved the clipper’s requirements for Leonard’s load management. The clipper will not be punished for the “high profile” of old rivers. Previously, the League did not allow the team to rotate players in the national live broadcast, with a maximum fine of $100000, but the clipper and Leonard seem to have obtained the permission of the league.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Carrick's rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won't pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs/d1737d6053f345f69e10ecbc2a79e198.jpg" alt="Carrick&#39;s rotation, the Clippers lost the jazz, the League won&#39;t pursue punishment, just to stay to play Spurs"><br>Of course, in November, the race schedule of the clippers is very difficult. Although they are all home games, look at the opponents: spurs, jazz, bucks, blazers, raptors, red teams, five teams in a row, all of which are the top eight opponents in the East and West. Even if Paojiao can come back in November, at present, the Clippers are still very dependent on Leonard, not excluding a few rounds of rest Card possibilities. Regular season is still long, clippers have this capital.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Lakers were 17 points behind the bulls. LeBron James became the MVP of the game. He played 35 minutes, got 30 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists and 2 steals from 19 shots and 10 rebounds. Among them, 3-pointers, 6 for 2, and free throws, 9 for 8. Got three double performances in game 84 of his career. Today, James is full of energy, and he has tried his best in defense. Compared with last season, he can’t move at the same speed.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He's been holding on for three years/ddc332b12e474bc3a26b4f2ff74085bf.jpg" alt="Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He&#39;s been holding on for three years"><br>According to NBA data network, when James is present this season, the Lakers can net 14.9 points over their opponents in the 100 rounds, while the Lakers lose 7.2 points in the 100 rounds after James leaves. But this strange phenomenon is now being solved because the Lakers’ bench is starting to rise. Today in the absence of James and Davis at the end of the day. Howard + Kuzma + Cook + Caruso picked up the team, they played a 16-0 attack wave.<br>Kuzma played 21 minutes and scored 15 points and 4 rebounds. Lakers fans have been envious of the Clippers’ substitutes this season, especially their luway and Harrell, who often help the starting line-up to fill the hole. Now the Lakers have a trump substitute.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He's been holding on for three years/7a59368ada704654a2574df4e9eb8fc7.jpg" alt="Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He&#39;s been holding on for three years"><br>In addition, bald Mamba Caruso has also become a major player in today’s Lakers’ win. In the last offensive round, Caruso completed the death winding at the defensive end. After the snatch, he went straight to the front court and scored 2 + 1, making the Lakers’ morale reach the peak. At the end of the festival, Caruso and LeBron James also had a passionate chest bump celebration.<br>Many people always underestimate Caruso, because he is really unknown and has no sense of existence. And hair loss is serious at a young age, although born in 1994, only 25 years old. But the hairline betrayed Caruso, but the so-called baldness became stronger. Caruso has always been a tough hero for the Lakers. A lot of people look down on Caruso’s defense.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He's been holding on for three years/d9d8c3e8a72c477993003f857805ad8a.jpg" alt="Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He&#39;s been holding on for three years"><br>According to NBA statistics, Caruso’s defensive efficiency this season is 92.8, surpassing Howard Davis and Miami’s Jimmy Butler. Currently ranked 17th in the league, it is worth mentioning that in the opening stage, the defense efficiency of kaluso was once ranked first in the league. These games have been a bit down, but there is no denying that he is an excellent defender.<br>Sometimes the data can evaluate a player, but sometimes it can’t. For example, Howard and McGrady, McGrady’s data is better than Howard’s, but the role of Howard on the field is to finish off McGrady.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He's been holding on for three years/2a96a8b490a945999ad5c1832a501928.jpg" alt="Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He&#39;s been holding on for three years"><br>Today, kaluso played 24 minutes, 2 for 8, 7 points, 3 rebounds, 1 assists and 2 steals. Although shooting is not good, but it is full of passion. Coach Vogel has also praised the defensive ability of the bald Mamba more than once. In addition, Caruso talked about LeBron James after the game, he was excited.<br>“Thank you to my brother LeBron, who was the first one to come up today and bump my chest to celebrate,” said Caruso. But I’m going to tell LeBron, brother, you really don’t realize how strong this physical confrontation is and how strong your body is. I had a 60-80 pound impact. Obviously LeBron was excited about my performance, I was excited, and we just couldn’t help it. Of course, I’m very tactful. I didn’t face all the head-on collisions. Otherwise, I might score the injury list of the team tomorrow.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He's been holding on for three years/09e3e9aa21394fa5a725470d8867a37f.jpg" alt="Death wrap 2 + 1! Caruso thanks the Lakers. He&#39;s been holding on for three years"><br>In 16, Caruso took part in the NBA draft, but was not selected. At that time, 30 teams, including the Lakers, were out of sight. But the Lakers were also carlusso’s bole, and they found the gold. Caruso is also very grateful to the Lakers. He showed his loyalty to the Lakers again after today’s game.</p>

    <title>Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of today’s game, the lone ranger field beat the Cavaliers 131-111. The protagonist of this game is undoubtedly Luca Dongqi, the cornerstone of the lone ranger. In today’s game, the Middle East Qi blew up again. With 3:44 left in the third quarter, he got three pairs of data. After playing in the third quarter, dongqiqi scored 27 points, 12 boards and 12 assists in 9 of 15 shots. Dongqiqi has won three pairs in two consecutive games and three games. Let people see the shadow of the next LeBron James, it can be said that dongqiqi will really become a superstar. No, it should be said that dongqiqi is a superstar now, and he is only 20 years old.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight/c9e817ce944e495eae091538f48e8028.jpg" alt="Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight"><br>At the age of 20, dongqiqi’s style of playing is like a 28 year old veteran who is at the peak of his career physically and mentally. Dongqiqi’s scoring methods are numerous and efficient, his ability to connect in series, and his performance of daring to take action without dropping the chain at a critical moment. It’s like the new Nowitzki. Dongqiqi’s existence has transformed the lone Rangers. They are very hopeful to enter the playoffs this year. In today’s competition, dongqiqi’s influence has exploded in the Cavaliers’ 120 million Mr. Lefu and 82 million Mr. Thompson. He has crushed the 200 million combination.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight/7c2cc257737f4d8d904f31e67e6e2e73.jpg" alt="Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight"><br>In the first three quarters, the knight can fight with the lone ranger. You can come to me. In the first section, the lone ranger Lefu became the main attack point of the knights, while the lone ranger relied on dongqiqi and Lefu to fight against each other. After the first quarter, lone ranger led by 3 points, 31-28. In the second quarter, Cleveland’s backup began to work. Clarkson hit three points in a row. Porter also scored three points. Cleveland once led by four points. However, the lone ranger also began to work under the leadership of Poseidon, and a wave of 13-2 surpassed the knight by 6 points. The lone ranger was still five points ahead at half-time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double core 47 + 23!

Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight"><br>In the second half, the Cavaliers got into a deadlock. Knight hit three points and Thompson hit 2 + 1. On the other hand, lone Rangers rely on dongqiqi and Boban to kill the four sides. East Qiqi cut 4 points in a row, and repeatedly assisted Boban in-house to win. At the end of the third quarter, lone ranger was still four points ahead. Just when everyone thought that the knights would start to work at the end of the festival, the lone ranger took the lead in attacking.<br>At the end of the game, the lone ranger started with 5 points in a row, and then Boban became the main attack point. He was brave enough to attack the Cavaliers’ basket. Lone ranger leads to 15 points with an 11-2 attack. The game was basically killed, and the lone ranger won steadily.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight/c5e0dcc9229e4f3caaf28486b0180524.jpg" alt="Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight"><br>In the whole game, dongqiqi scored 29 points, 14 boards and 15 assists, while polzingis scored 18 points, 9 boards and 6 hats. Today, the two core players jointly scored 47 + 23 data. Cleveland’s side is completely relying on lefo, he got 29 points and 8 boards, while Thompson played generally 4 out of 10 with 11 points and 12 boards, down from the previous games.<br>It’s worth mentioning that today’s lone Rangers have achieved 4-2 results after winning the game. They officially surpassed a certain team and reached the top eight in the West. Today, after a team was slaughtered by the heat, they are no longer in the top eight in the West. We can only say that the heat is great. This year, a team is really not good.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight/a0480806f44c4835a274feeeeb291274.jpg" alt="Double core 47 + 23! Dongqiqi smashes the 200 million giant group, and the lone ranger gets rid of a team and gets into the top eight"><br>In the past, Texas had three illusions: a strong team, a weak Mavericks and an old spurs. At present, the three illusions return again. The Mavericks are strong, the Spurs are not old, and a team is really weak. The lone ranger has been silent for a long time, and should rise again.</p>

They won a wave of five and five in a row. LeBron James has a feeling of returning to the top. It’s frustrating that the Lakers didn’t make it to the playoffs last season. Not only are Lakers fans ridiculed, but James is also questioned and ridiculed, especially for his groin injury and his comeback failed to lead the team to win.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row!

James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>At that time, the US media thought that James had lost his dominance and failed to play Clippers at the beginning of the new season. The US media even said that James had retired from the throne. But James returned with action. In addition, after the Lakers won five consecutive games, James couldn’t help but vent. In the interview, he was even a little angry, especially the external evaluation of his groin injury, James could not bear it any more.<br>James finally explained why he was not in good shape and could not lead the team to the playoffs after returning last season. James thought that his groin was still in tears at that time, but he forced to come back, but did not get the understanding of the outside world.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis/f777b6b532f44120b526535cf30547f1.jpg" alt="Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>James said that last season after he came back, his condition greatly decreased, especially his movement speed and explosive power. Some of the movements before the injury could not be performed, and the injury destroyed everything. The groin injury even affected James’ defense, after holding it for seven months. Obviously James had a showdown, and he made a big commitment. In the new season, if he is injured, he will not be forced to return as last season, which is not good for the team and himself.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row!

James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>Davis also announced James’ decision in an interview today, and he has already told bushbrow what he thinks.<br>Davis said: “people always misunderstand LeBron, especially last season. They question his defense, but I think in the new season LeBron just wants to be himself. He used to be a great defender. Especially in the past few games, we have done our best in defense. As he told me, he didn’t want to get hurt any more, so he got his speed back, he got his body back to the point where he could play defense again. In addition, we will also support him (we got his back) at the defensive end   “<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis/f71565ab8758405a9872f2f7d4a0c519.jpg" alt="Five wins in a row! James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>It has to be said that Davis understands James. Today, Davis joked. James calls Jamie’s combination “peanut butter banana sandwich”. James hopes that in the future, their combination can be turned into “peanut butter jam sandwich”. Because peanut butter jam sandwich is a combination of James and Wade, their cooperation has been practiced.<br>So becoming a peanut butter jam sandwich is the next step for James and Davis. In addition, Howard today also ushered in a big positive, he used performance to defeat the biggest black man in his career. He’s Lakers star Shaq. We all know O’Neill is a Howard black powder. He always goes to black Howard with all his heart. It’s not pleasant to see Warcraft.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Five wins in a row!

James finally let it out and made a promise to Davis"><br>But today O’Neill finally recognized Howard and began to appreciate his professional attitude. O’Neill published an interview video of Howard on the INS on social media. In the interview, Howard said that in his mind, the best team in the history of the Lakers is: James + magician + Kobe + O’Neill + Jabbar, and the sixth is Howard himself.<br>O’Neill was very satisfied with this, he praised Howard: “thank you, Superman Howard, you played well, keep it up, be proud of you!  </p>

What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can't do, the heat did first/79cd657648a042b18b2d6ce2bea757c4.jpg" alt="For the first time in the season! What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can&#39;t do, the heat did first"><br>But it’s just that we can’t beat the heat in this game! As Duan ran said, from all angles, it seems unreasonable. Only the heat can restrain the sun’s playing method. Butler and Adebayor’s forward combination limit the sun’s three-point goal today to only 11 out of 32. After the heat came on the bench, under the leadership of drajic and orinico, they also played triumphant songs all the way. Butler in the first half and Della in the second half Jiqi, let the sun have no chance to breathe!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/For the first time in the season!

What the clippers, warriors and 76ers can&#39;t do, the heat did first"><br>Of course, the sun’s future schedule is also very difficult, need to face the test of the nets, the Lakers, including the back-to-back Celtic king, to see if they can maintain the top four position in the West.</p>

    <title>Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/Four%20star%20blast%20cut%2083%20points!%20The%20only%20unbeaten%20team%20in%20the%20League%20will%20be%20born,%20and%20there%20will%20be%20no%20one%20to%20stop%20it%20when%20embid%20comes%20back/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the 76 beat the Blazers 129-128 away. In this game, the great enbid did not play, 76 people still have four-star seat, hofford + Harris + Simmons + Richardson. Today, the ball is also really good-looking, in the core is not in the case of 76 people have been playing under pressure, once 21 points behind. But at the critical moment, the Blazers didn’t hold on to the victory. Kokmazi killed the Blazers in 0.4 seconds and 3 minutes. In the past, Roy and Lillard both performed the last-minute kill. This time, the pioneers experienced the bitter results of the past for the first time. It was so hard to be killed.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/8cab39cd9afb42218b1e119752fb209d.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>From the start of the first quarter, the Blazers had the upper hand. They started 10-2. They were full of desire to attack and went with the wind and water. But Simmons is not to be outdone. In the absence of embid, he kept hitting the basket to score. Lillard also responded to Simmons in time at the end of the festival. The first quarter trailblazers led by 5 points, 32-27. In the second quarter, the attack of the pioneers did not decrease. Hood made a good jump shot. In the middle of hezonia, the pioneers made a wave of 6-0. The Blazers still led the 76ers by 11 points at 68-57 in the half.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/4f22cf979e5945a294ba5a9703bde4c8.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>In the second half, under the leadership of Lillard, the trailblazers continued to spread the difference, once leading to 21 points. When 76 people were on the brink of extinction, they finally woke up like a dream. Harris has scored five points in a row, while Simmons and hofford are also firing. In the last minute, the 76ers got 6 points, and at the end of the three quarters, they were 10 points behind. Once again, the game was full of suspense.<br>At the end of the day, it was true that Horford started the mode of killing with a big shot. He hit two goals in the basket, and the 76ers were close to three points at one time. The Blazers began to worry, and Lillard came out in time. He hit three points first to stop bleeding, and then he joined hands with Bates morellion to score three points. Once again, the pioneers have the advantage, leading by 3 points!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/517ad017a3bb4ab7a2f1fc6572993a67.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>The 76ers didn’t lose hope. At the last moment, Horford made a tough layup, and Simmons helped the 76ers to exceed one point in two free throws. And Lillard also showed his heart in life and death. In a round, Lillard scored a three-point shot for anfini. Leave 76 people 2.2 seconds. I didn’t expect that kirkmatz took the chance to kill in the last 0.4 seconds and 3 minutes.<br>In the whole game, 76 players and four stars played perfectly, scoring 83 points, Simmons 18 points, Horford 25 points, Richardson 17 points and Harris 23 points. In the absence of ebbed, the 76ers fought a tough battle. Lillard became a lone hero. He got 33 points and 9 out of 11-3 points and couldn’t get back to the sky.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/828b948206b24ccba41ecbae7d099c6e.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>Last season, the 76ers lost to the Raptors, but they are the only team in the league that can fight against the Raptors in seven games. If it wasn’t for Leonard’s three points in the basket and the 76ers’ extra time, it’s hard to say who was the champion last season. For the 76ers were not afraid of the Bucks, and their five great deaths could be compared to the bucks. Even in terms of configuration, the 76ers are more fierce than the Raptors.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/26240438d6f540c68a1d06e9c02fd62d.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>Although the 76ers lost Jimmy Butler this summer, Richardson also filled in Butler’s vacancy. Once the 76ers put out the five-star lineup of Simmons + enbid + Harris + Richardson + hofford, they are basically unstoppable. This year’s bucks don’t seem to have made much progress in shooting, while hofford, the 76ers, is a sharp weapon against alphanum.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back/e269541ad0e4459ea4137f06a24a684a.jpg" alt="Four star blast cut 83 points! The only unbeaten team in the League will be born, and there will be no one to stop it when embid comes back"><br>Once the 76ers five-star run in this season is complete, they can declare the end of the Eastern Conference. As Barkley said, the 76ers are the most promising team in the east to reach the finals. At present, the 76ers lead the league in five consecutive starts, and they are the only unbeaten team.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 5, the nets met Pelican at home. After the new season, the two teams were in a normal state. Owen was too late to be in the same rhythm with his teammates. On the pelican side, Zion’s injury also made the team very passive. With the outbreak of Yingge, Pelican had a significant improvement. The final result was 135-125, and the nets won the game without danger. For the current nets, this victory can be called timely rain.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Gods fight! James's two teammates scored 79 points! Durant's successor forced the best Owen/d7955dbd22934e1eb6369a72624ee1dd.jpg" alt="Gods fight! James&#39;s two teammates scored 79 points! Durant&#39;s successor forced the best Owen"><br>Before the game, New York media revealed that the previous concern of the nets about Owen’s emotions has made Owen feel very uncomfortable. Owen doesn’t want to be concerned again because of off-site problems. At this sensitive moment, the pelican match coincided with Ingram’s return, obviously the game became very difficult to play.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Gods fight! James's two teammates scored 79 points! Durant's successor forced the best Owen/ba312a1e09254cf5911a35d03ae68637.jpg" alt="Gods fight! James&#39;s two teammates scored 79 points!

As old Zhan’s former two big teammates, Owen and Ingram started a fierce fight in this field, and Owen finally smiled to the end.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Gods fight! James's two teammates scored 79 points! Durant's successor forced the best Owen/2b62f79798794728993f9f2370cbcd57.jpg" alt="Gods fight! James&#39;s two teammates scored 79 points! Durant&#39;s successor forced the best Owen"><br>Throughout the first half, the nets firmly grasp the initiative of the game. In the first quarter, the nets hit a 7-0 climax under the leadership of Owen and temple, then the two sides fell into a deadlock, leading the nets by 6 points in a single quarter. In the second quarter, the pelican attack the dud, 3 minutes a point did not get, and Jordan Jordan even took 4 points, Pelican hit a wave of 11-0 climax after the anti super score, Owen led Leverett, temple three points in a row, the end of the net is a wave of 6-0, nets half 67-50 lead Pelican.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Gods fight!

Durant&#39;s successor forced the best Owen"><br>In the third quarter, Pelican wake up, Ingram strong 2 + 1 layup, ball brother and Hart three-point icing on the cake, Owen frequently hit the basket to kill also cut 10 points, pelican is a wave of 7-0 at the end of the quarter! But in the fourth quarter, the two sides continued to bite the score, little Jordan sprained his ankle, Yingge led the team to score six points in a row, once equalizing the difference, and then Owen shot in color, at the last moment, Yingge cut another four points, but Harris’s three points killed the game, the score was set at 135-125!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Gods fight!

Durant&#39;s successor forced the best Owen"><br>In the third quarter of the game, Ingram scored 10 points and 3 assists, once led the pelican team to reduce the score to a single digit, at this time, the rest of the basketball net players fell into a downturn, Owen responded continuously, layup 2 + 1, emergency stop throwing, back three points, 18 points in a single quarter, helping the basketball net to maintain the leading edge. Owen is very efficient on the offensive side today. He has 13 free throws in 21, 11 free throws, 39 points, 9 assists, 3 steals and 5 mistakes. He can respond to Yingge in such a hot state, only Owen.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Gods fight! James's two teammates scored 79 points! Durant's successor forced the best Owen/208d3a90ddb64737b278d0b604ae9947.jpg" alt="Gods fight! James&#39;s two teammates scored 79 points! Durant&#39;s successor forced the best Owen"><br>So far, the net’s record is only 3-4, which is far lower than the fans’ expectation. In fact, since the start of the game, their schedule has been relatively easy, including continuous games against the Knicks, grizzlies, walkers, pistons and other teams. However, the game of the net often falls into two kinds of error areas: either Owen’s supernatural play and his teammates feel flat; or Owen’s full assistance to his teammates and teammates Feel open, but the game won’t win. Even a lot of American media began to question Owen: can you lead the team to the playoffs alone? In front of all kinds of pressures, Owen needs to stand out, but other teammates of the basketball net also need to pull Owen. After all, compared with Russell, Owen has a low attitude when he comes to the basketball net, and he is willing to take the initiative to do the pick and tear, to give his teammates a dowry to send assists, and the basketball net still needs to break in.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Gods fight! James's two teammates scored 79 points! Durant's successor forced the best Owen/3047e7f3e7724ed9aee196cc2c2ba76a.jpg" alt="Gods fight! James&#39;s two teammates scored 79 points! Durant&#39;s successor forced the best Owen"><br>For pelicans, it’s a mixed blessing. The worry is the injury of Zion, which is expected to be absent for a while. In this period, Ingram’s outbreak is very surprising. In addition to the early departure of the first world war with thunder, Ingram’s six games on behalf of pelican in the new season, the average contribution of 29 points per game, the hit rate of 51.1%, which really deserves the title of Durant’s successor. Ingram is only 22 years old, just in Life is just in its infancy! He didn’t have a chance in the Lakers, but came to the pelican. In the absence of Zion, he was the team’s number one scoring point, and he perfectly shouldered the burden.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Gods fight! James's two teammates scored 79 points! Durant's successor forced the best Owen/fb5a576b2d61470084623aacddf1d327.jpg" alt="Gods fight! James&#39;s two teammates scored 79 points! Durant&#39;s successor forced the best Owen"><br>Pelican should be in a dilemma. Knowing that Yingge is in such a hot condition, Pelican should complete the renewal ahead of the season. Now they all have the last year’s rookie contract. According to Ingram’s current condition, next summer, he is enough to fight for a 170 million dollar contract to challenge Simmons and Murray!</p>

    <url>/2020/11/06/Hit%20rate%20up%20to%2079.2%25!%20James%20called%20Howard%20on%20the%20roll%20and%20Vogel%20gave%20him%20a%20big%20gift/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles Lakers won again today. They beat the strong spurs to win five consecutive games. Since the start of the game, the Lakers began to wake up. They played a tough offensive and defensive standard, especially today’s Spurs are very difficult, the Lakers once achieved a 19 point lead. But the Spurs even out the difference at the end of the season, but James Howard finished the harvest at the last minute. Of course, there’s pop’s bravery. Today James’s performance is not much to say, let’s focus on Howard. Today, Warcraft made 7 shots, scoring 14 points, 13 rebounds and 2 blocks.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift/fec71405a8d34d4c996cf5edbd8c542f.jpg" alt="Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift"><br>According to the statistics of American media data website, combined with today’s game, Howard’s hit rate this season has increased to 79.2%, which is the highest hit rate in the League at present. In the history of NBA, the player with the highest shooting rate in a season was Wilt Chamberlain in 1972-73, when the shooting rate of coach Zhang reached 72.7%.<br>We don’t know if Howard can break Chamberlain’s record, but we can see that Howard has changed. He’s not the old Howard, who doesn’t like the pick and roll, who likes to go to the post singles. If you don’t give the ball right, you’re not happy. You’re not active on the defensive side.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift/b259447186bd4a5180b9df20952027f3.jpg" alt="Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift"><br>Now Howard is doing the dirty work in the past. In the past, he despised the work very much. Now Howard is enjoying it. And Howard is also very versatile, today in an offensive round, Howard high possession, Davis Cut. Howard gave Davis a cake and dunk, which surprised him. At that time, the fans didn’t believe it was Howard’s passing. They thought it was a mistake. They regarded James as Howard and the result was really Howard’s passing.<br>It can only be said that the current world of Warcraft is really fragrant, that is, playing diligently. If Howard was willing to do these jobs in the Lakers, and cooperate with Kobe Bryant, maybe he won’t be as successful as he is now.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift/0b22a14aa6914cd1b81a1a2f189450ed.jpg" alt="Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift"><br>LeBron James also named Howard’s performance after the game. James also shouted a slogan “Superman” that he didn’t have for a long time. He called Howard Superman again.<br>James said: “  I’m getting used to the role of point guard now, and our team is getting better and better. Our execution is very strong, no matter what kind of opponent we are facing, we can concentrate on it. Today, I feel good shooting at the offensive end, and the defensive end also stops the opponent’s attack. And we have Superman (Howard), as long as we don’t shoot, he will fight for offensive rebounds, and make-up, dunk, he’s great tonight. The combination of Howard and Davis is great on the defensive side!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift/5b95a5e17ece431d974919911f33f1f9.jpg" alt="Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift"><br>In addition, McGrady only played 11 minutes today. Some fans asked why Vogel didn’t let Howard play in the first place? Do you want McGee to be a fake starter? It’s a great gift for Howard to make a statement after today’s game. Because Vogel is protecting Howard, he attaches great importance to Howard, he thinks Howard will play better in the second team. In other words, the Lakers’ use of Howard is more like the use of the Clippers’ use of Harrell, not only as a wizard, but also to increase the vitality of the second team.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift/e5e3b407ce93405bb5d1457776972ce7.jpg" alt="Hit rate up to 79.2%! James called Howard on the roll and Vogel gave him a big gift"><br>“We know that Howard has the ability to play like this and I’m happy that he has fully accepted his role in the team,” said Vogel. He played as a substitute instead of starting. He was more like a sixth man. And this role is something he hasn’t tried before. After all, he used to be an all star, but he did what we asked for. Howard is very dominant on the defensive side. His rebounds and blocks are very important to us! “</p>

    <title>In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, Golden State Warriors lost 87-93 to Hornets in three straight games. The warriors are now 1-5, the worst opening record since Steve Cole coached the warriors. And today the warriors four-star all absences, Thompson did not say much, basically last season reimburses does not have the opportunity to come back. In addition, Curie will be absent for three months due to fracture, green will not play because of ligament injury of fingers, Russell will be absent because of injury. The magnificent lineup that warriors set up this summer has become an off-site audience. It has to be said that Fengshui from Datong center is not good. Warriors have just moved to meet with one another’s bad news.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5/a68275e9a953415fb2d198cfc59c5eb4.jpg" alt="In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5"><br>It seems that the warriors have been in good health in the past few years. This season is going to pay off debts. Today’s game is nothing to say. Let’s peck at each other. Warriors sent out a team than the past five-star simply want to cry. Their starting lineups are: Bowman, Poole, Robinson III, Pascal, and colistan, including three rookies.<br>In the process of the game, warriors really tried their best. At the beginning of the first quarter, rookie Pascal showed a good state of continuous scoring, and then Robinson began to break out. The warriors once took the lead, but the Hornets were not outdone. Bacon and Zeller responded in succession. Warriors lead 5 points 30-25 in the first quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5/be3e33ce800044f5af8bd0f5c2ba00d9.jpg" alt="In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5"><br>In the second section, the warriors, relying on the cooperation of the team, once gained a 10 point lead. Especially Damien Lilian, Kuri’s brother-in-law, scored 7 points. When the wasp was on the brink of extinction, rosier finally woke up. He made all the next four shots, and wasp’s potential star this year, Washington, also helped Rozier, with a violent dunk on a fast break to boost morale. In the half-time, the hornet chased 50-55!<br>In the third quarter, both sides fell into strangulation, and their hands were not good. Warriors scored 16 points in a single quarter, while Hornets scored 18. In the third quarter, the hornet will score close to 3 points. At the end of the season, the Hornets finally began to work, which is the huge gap between the NBA main force and the substitute. The hornet’s Munk and zeleyong are not to be taken. The combination of Marvin and Washington also had a third rain. The hornet finally led the warriors by one point in the last 1:09.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5/01937fc412eb4208b7d2c2df19a765af.jpg" alt="In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5"><br>At the end of the day, my brother-in-law made a mistake, while rosier killed the match with two penalties. The highlight of the game is undoubtedly Pascal, who scored 25 points and 4 boards in 10 of 34 minutes and 18 minutes. In addition, Robinson also got 16 points, 8 boards, 3 assists and 2 breaks, while colistan got 8 points and 8 boards. The hornet’s two guns are still fierce bacon 25 points + rocil 19 points, 5 boards and 7 assists.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5/e0e766cc7c0240fcb35591485b4cc19e.jpg" alt="In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5"><br>After today’s game, Cole was not in high spirits. After shaking hands with his opponent’s coach, Cole left the field directly. According to NBA statistics, warriors’ starting salary today is only $7 million. It’s probably the most pitiful start in the league right now.<br>In the past the warriors had a terrible squad, Durant + curry + Thompson + Green + igodara. Cole’s passing and cutting system can also be played.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5/b04eac784229478ab59b0b417614a28f.jpg" alt="In 18, 10 hits 25 + 4, the second round show became the only bright spot of warriors, Cole left in frustration, 1-5"><br>But as Durant said this summer, the system is not particularly helpful to a player, especially a superstar. They are still in charge at the critical moment. And without superstars, even Jackson’s triangle tactics, without Jordan and Kobe, it would not work.</p>

    <title>Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10/c71eaae329e44ebf87d2211868ee11af.jpg" alt="Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10"><br>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 5, grizzlies played a red team in the west at home. After a lot of thinking, the team name was not mentioned, but there were two names that could be mentioned, including harden and weishao. Wei Shao’s game is suspended. Hardon alone led the team to score 44 points and 10 rebounds, and 6 assists and 6 mistakes. Finally, he beat Grizzlies without danger. As for why Hardon was named, the answer is revealed at the end of the article.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10/fb494b7fc7764fb5bae8186ecd111721.jpg" alt="Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10"><br>In terms of data, for Grizzlies, wallan scored 10 points and 10 rebounds, Brooks scored 17 points and 9 rebounds, and Morant scored 23 points and 6 assists and 5 rebounds. In addition, Jones, Anderson and kapoklo also scored double. On the red team’s side, Haden scored 44 points, 10 rebounds and 6 assists in 12 of 28, 7 of 16 three-point goals, 6 mistakes, small forward hut scored 15 points and 9 rebounds, power forward tough guy, 0 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists, center 10 points and 13 rebounds (6 front court), round face guard scored 16 points and 5 rebounds.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10/af9fb3b1f29f402fa92fe8e9808779c3.jpg" alt="Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10"><br>In fact, the Grizzlies are listed as one of the five tank teams by ESPN this season. Their strength is just like that. They sent off Xiao Jia and Conley and rebuilt the team around Morant. But it will take time. The whole team is out of shape. In the first six games of the season, they are 1-5. Red team, 4-3, but the outside feel is very poor, including the previous bucks reversal, and wizards hit 159-158 embarrassing percentage points, a single quarter by the heat, 46 points and other humiliating records, there are also American media think boss Fei really need to think about whether the position of general manager should be changed, not only because of the previous things, but also because the team does not present the outside world Expectations for them. Not even the second tier in the West.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10/3c93b6ec85e24df2bef5e57cc4871f0d.jpg" alt="Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10"><br>As they showed, today’s game with Grizzlies, the two sides have tied many times, unable to open the gap. In the first quarter, Morant continued to break through and kill, and Valan also continued to play in the middle distance. The red team relied on Hardon’s continuous shooting and punishment to gradually smooth the difference. After 16 draws, Hardon scored two and three points, and the team began to take the initiative. The Grizzlies fell 5 points in the single quarter. In the second quarter, the Grizzlies relied on substitutes kapoklo and Clarke to smooth the difference. The two sides drew from 35 to 60. It seems that the red team has perfectly integrated into this section. The red team led the Grizzlies 62-60 at half-time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West.

Grizzlies take advantage of the opponent’s opposite disadvantage on the front line to create a continuous medium distance shooting opportunity. Hardon first gets 4 points by himself, then assists teammates to hit 2-3 points in a row. The red team’s outside hand begins to open, once leading 10 points. In the fourth quarter, Morant continued to cut points to further reduce the difference, including harden’s breakthrough was also perfectly limited by Grizzlies’ inclusion, grizzlies once reduced the difference to 6 points with Brooks’s continuous score. At the critical moment, harden took a three-point step backward, which was another chance to make free throws. Finally, grizzlies lost 7 points at home.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10/8ae4610ae16e4fb893fccc276d2d831b.jpg" alt="Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10"><br>In fact, in the past few years, the name of harden has been replaced by a mustache and HD. However, the author has seen such a small video in his spare time. In the shooting training before the new season, harden always takes the ancient copper coin given to him by the fans when he travels in China this summer, which is worn on his right wrist and inseparable. When the reporter is shooting, harden always It will show the copper coin intentionally or unintentionally.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10/7fcbe6eaf770468e8f8ce7bd67b484ee.jpg" alt="Into the third echelon of the west Grizzlies lose a team in the West. Harden kills 44 + 10"><br>Like weishao, Hardon may be under pressure from all sides and criticized by public opinion, but they really express their attitude with actions. Do you think they can not hate someone? What’s wrong with harden and wesa? In the past few days, the threats and pressures they have suffered may be unimaginable, but at the end of the day, Haden may need our support, name, not just respect.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Clippers beat the Spurs 103-97 at home in an NBA regular season that ended at noon on November 1. With 22 seconds left in the game, the Spurs chose to give up and finally ended their three winning streak! For the Spurs, this is the fourth game of the new season, but the team’s biggest problem is still not solved, no one can score, no reasonable way to end the attack! As the No. 1 scorer of the Spurs last season, Adelman played 36 minutes in the game, 2 out of 8, with 5 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 mistakes, plus or minus - 10.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/It's only 5 points!

Patterson came up to consume him, including huckles and green in the dislocation, who are trying to push Adelaide out to the greatest extent. They are determined not to Let him close to the basket, Adelaide only made the opponent three fouls today, and he got two free throws in total.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/It's only 5 points!

In an attack, drozan is against Beverly. When drozan is ready to make a breakthrough, Beverly has an obvious pull action on his hand. Drozan leans on Beverly and both sides fall to the ground in entanglement.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/It's only 5 points!

Drozan was bullied, Popovich rushed up, but he was watching"><br>At this time, players from both sides quickly surrounded, including Harrell, Ludwig and Kaka are ready to pull apart the two people who are angry. Of course, Beverly quickly turned to one side, while drozan was trapped in the Clippers’ encirclement.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/It's only 5 points!

Drozan was bullied, Popovich rushed up, but he was watching"><br>Of course, there is no doubt about the team spirit of Adelaide, but it can be seen clearly that Adelaide’s whole state is not online, the attack is free from the system, and the defense is dedicated, but if he has no contribution in the attack, who can the Spurs expect?<br>The Spurs have won three games in a row in the past three games, all of which have been won and stuttered, while Adelaide only got 27 points and 9 rebounds when he was a wizard. In the last game, the Blazers only had 17 of 6. The Spurs need him to play.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/It's only 5 points!

Drozan was bullied, Popovich rushed up, but he was watching"><br>After losing this game, the Spurs fell to the No.1 position in the west, but the schedule of the Spurs in November was too dangerous. They had 17 games in 30 days, including three back-to-back games. The next five games: Warriors, Lakers, eagles, thunder, Celtic. If Adelaide continues in this state, I’m afraid the Spurs will not be able to maintain competitiveness in the cruel West.</p>

    <title>Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/Lakers%20surprise!%207%20+%202%20black%20horse%20power%20pushes%20Howard%20to%20the%20top,%20he%20is%20the%20best%20defender%20in%20three%20times/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Lakers won four straight games away, 119-110 to beat the lone Rangers. The Lakers’ record in the new season is obviously beyond the expectation of the fans. Especially after losing to Clippers in the first game, the Lakers fell into depression. A lot of fans also say that the Lakers need to break in, but in the next four games, they were blinded, and they greatly improved in both attack and defense. Howard’s protective frame, Davis’s offensive ability, James’s overall view.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/fbaeb94909244e9c818fabaa8bc07d6a.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>And James has been improving in the last four games, and today he’s a big four. James is the first Lakers player to score at least 30 + 10 + 15 since 1990. At present, the Lakers have reached the top of the Western Conference. They are very balanced both in attack and defense. It’s also great to play hard, and there’s another surprise for the Lakers: balman bacaluso.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/76ecabc984ea426b893ed0b7e9e78514.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>With more than 9 minutes left in the fourth quarter of today’s competition, Caruso entered the inner line. Facing the lone ranger’s inner line Kleiber, he completed a four seater barrier and showed his physical fitness. Many fans may not have a big impression of Caruso, and he has serious hair loss. This makes the fans always feel that he is not young and has a low sense of existence. In fact, Caruso was only 25 years old in 1994. In today’s game, Caruso played 15 minutes, 3 out of 5 got 7 points and 2 rebounds, although the data is not eye-catching, but Caruso is the Lakers’ real defensive first man, fiercer than Howard Davis.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/2c1519ae37f14f6182eb36cf1c7c1967.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>In the latest defensive efficiency list, Caruso came in second, in fact, almost the same as the first. After all, Aton only played one game, and Caruso played four. Caruso’s current defensive efficiency is 79.4 points, while Coyote’s okoggi is 82.2. The 76ers’ emptybill is 85, while the Lakers’ Howard is 89.4.<br>The Lakers also have three people on the list, Davis + pop + Kuzma. Davis finished 36th with 94.4 defense efficiency. Pop came 28th on 92.8. Kuzma played a game today, ranking 29th with 92.9 defense efficiency.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/ba90f48e02844631ad62d7d0fbbe0ab8.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>After the game LeBron James and Davis praised the performance of Caruso, including today’s dunk to show his physical fitness. In addition, there is the defense ability of Caruso. As coach Vogel said, people always underestimate Caruso and seldom know that he is a player with both attack and defence.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/5ba4bb85085a4a56a562ca04d4b52be3.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>Davis said of Caruso: “today, Caruso came out and played in the right way, and he can make the right decision. Especially when he hit the basket tonight. He’s the kind of player who plays hard and knows how to play. We need players like him in our team!<br>Caruso is very calm on the court, he is a player who plays with his head completely. The so-called bald nature will become stronger. God deprived Caruso of his hair, but gave him a calm heart.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times/f2fa6ec1f0c04280a55e114f9cb47857.jpg" alt="Lakers surprise! 7 + 2 black horse power pushes Howard to the top, he is the best defender in three times"><br>Often players like Caruso are stronger when the team is in adversity. No one could have guessed that Caruso would be second on the defensive efficiency list. Even Howard, the NBA’s three best defensive player, is just below Caruso.</p>

    <title>It&#39;s time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal&#39;s showdown</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/It&#39;s%20time%20for%20green%20to%20compromise!%20He%20has%20been%20holding%20back%20for%20seven%20years%20talking%20about%20Pascal&#39;s%20showdown/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Golden State Warriors finally won. Without Curie + Thompson + Green + Russell + Rooney, the warriors won the Blazers with a group of bottom paid players and rookies The score was 127-118, and the warriors defended the dignity of chase center. Of course, compared to Oracle arena, chase center must be toxic. It seems that the main force of Fengshui is injured. The good thing is that the substitutes are starting to rise and the character players are showing their talent. Especially warrior rookie Eric Pascal, who played 40 minutes today, got 36 points and 13 rebounds from 11 of 19 shots.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/It's time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal's showdown/652d2dfb31f44537ae94673bb0d84873.jpg" alt="It&#39;s time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal&#39;s showdown"><br>Pascal became the first rookie to score at least 36 points and 13 rebounds in nine years, according to NBA data, while the last was Blake Griffin. Pascal, who is 2.06 meters tall and weighs 116 kilograms, is the 11th rookie in the second round of this year. But his expression is impressive. Although Pascal is 23, he is more mature than the average rookie.<br>Pascal is a seamless connection to warriors, he may be the best rookie chosen by warriors in the past three years. Pascal can score 17 points and 4.4 boards per game this season, with a shooting rate of 60.3%.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/It's time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal's showdown/3b21231d93d24efcbcc51caf8631bbae.jpg" alt="It&#39;s time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal&#39;s showdown"><br>From Pascal we can see the shadow of the next dramonde green. We all know the two round rookies selected by warriors. In the end, he became a giant under the warrior system, and was the absolute hero of the warrior who won three championships in the past. Pascal has the hope of becoming the next green, and is still a low-key version of green.<br>We all know that dream chasing green is a double-edged sword. He often yells at coaches and teammates, sometimes with no face at all. Even Durant was scolded for running away. Cole has also been publicly challenged by green many times, and Pascal is very modest. He doesn’t like to shout at his teammates. He just uses his actions to boost morale.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/It's time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal's showdown/e6f597740db84e92b0b51020c6504a1e.jpg" alt="It&#39;s time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal&#39;s showdown"><br>Cole is also very nostalgic when he talks about Pascal after the game, because Pascal is very similar to green when he joined the league. At that time, green was an unknown role player on the bench, so his character was still low-key and silent. Later, green was used more and more.<br>“Pascal is very powerful and good at physical confrontation,” Cole said. He is also 6-foot-9 [2.06 meters] tall and very strong. He has a long arm span, just like Drummond green seven or eight years ago. Influence the team as a second round rookie. But he is different from green. He doesn’t like to talk very much. And he spent four years in college, which made him very mature. He can not only contribute to the defensive side, but also be very confident in the offensive side that he will have a high ceiling<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/It's time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal's showdown/d9e5daf8c18441b791cebbb216715c2f.jpg" alt="It&#39;s time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal&#39;s showdown"><br>Pascal’s height is 2.06M, while Green’s latest height is only 1.98M. In terms of the upper limit, Pascal’s extra height is more advantageous and low-key than Green’s playing position 4.<br>Pascal is not proud of himself after today’s game. For the warriors’ dressing room, Pascal is no doubt better. Compared with Green’s high position in the offensive end, the outside projection often hangs 0. Pascal’s attack is too strong. In other words, green is not as good as the rookie except for his defense and organization.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/It's time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal's showdown/4e179fa1a81643808528debc36fac127.jpg" alt="It&#39;s time for green to compromise! He has been holding back for seven years talking about Pascal&#39;s showdown"><br>Maybe it’s time for green to put up his big mouth and keep a low profile, or the warriors will trade him sooner or later, especially now there are substitutes.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 7, the NBA regular season Clippers will play the bucks at home. Both teams have shown excellent competitive status in the new season, with 5-2 results. Many people think they will meet in the finals in 2020. However, in such a nationwide live competition, Leonard is absent because of the lack of load management. We need to know that the clippers have rested for two days, but they chose to “retreat” at their own home, because they know that Day also back-to-back against the Blazers, it is clear that the Blazers as a soft persimmon!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady's comments are really sharp/0b8db0659c774dffbe75b04d813a4955.jpg" alt="Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady&#39;s comments are really sharp"><br>It’s Leonard’s second rotation of the season, and the Clippers boss Rivers said in an interview about Leonard’s injury. “Leonard feels good because of what we’ve been doing and there’s nothing to worry about,” he replied. “It’s our job to make sure he stays that way.” When asked what the fans who wanted to buy tickets to see Leonard play at home said, he joked: “they can see me.”<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady's comments are really sharp/2f506fa8ae2e41508feba1212a0e9484.jpg" alt="Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady&#39;s comments are really sharp"><br>However, the League did not punish the clippers, which had previously issued a memo saying that the team could be fined $100000 if it took turns to rest stars in live games across the United States. But the reason the Clippers didn’t get a fine was because Leonard had a knee injury. The Clippers’ team doctor thought that the current health of little card was not suitable for the back-to-back competition, and the League finally recognized this judgment.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady's comments are really sharp/157459c5c69547e095969b814ca67e56.jpg" alt="Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady&#39;s comments are really sharp"><br>However, despite this, the clippers or Leonard’s practice has attracted the attention of NBA’s Maddie. “I can understand that,” McGrady said on the TV program, “but tonight it’s the new MVP. What I can’t imagine is that if I’ve had a two-day break and people like Kobe, pierce and Iverson visit my home court, I’ll think about “let’s take a break today and get ready for tomorrow” and I’ll want to play alphabet brother, that’s what I want to play<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady's comments are really sharp/5032dc49446040b98ad00e38f04c94ad.jpg" alt="Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady&#39;s comments are really sharp"><br>At the same time, McGrady also believes that Leonard’s injury is not so serious, because in Monday’s clipper game against jazz, we all saw Leonard’s way of taking over the game at the end of the last quarter, and we can’t see that he was an injured person at all. And even if Leonard can’t play back-to-back, he can also choose to take a rest tomorrow against the Blazers, and play today’s play, not only for the fast home fans, but also because the regular season and bucks don’t have many opportunities to play.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady's comments are really sharp/47d678385b054480a936b027fc99a0ba.jpg" alt="Leonard lacks the style of an old school player when he chooses to avoid the fight against the letter brother McGrady&#39;s comments are really sharp"><br>It can only be said that Leonard and clipper are very cautious after experiencing the unhappiness of the Spurs period and seeing Durant’s painful lesson of rupture of Achilles tendon caused by his recovery from injury. They don’t want to bet on health because of a live regular season in the United States, although it will be considered that they are not strong enough and lack the spirit of old school players! But in the long run, the Clippers’ goal this season is to play the playoffs and win the championship. All of this is based on Leonard’s health, so it’s okay to take a rest.</p>

The opponent was the first in the league"><br>On November 4, a regular season NBA game ended at noon, clippers faced Jazz at home. After watching the first three quarters, I felt that clippers were going to lose, so I was ready to start writing. I watched half of the fourth quarter. OK, jazz was cheated! Leonard, you big liar, let the Jazz lead three and a half quarters. At last, you made a sudden effort. After two three-point goals, the Jazz mentality collapsed! 105-94, clippers win the jazz and win Game 5 of the season!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Mitchell's mind is broken! Leonard scored 18 points in the last quarter to make a big reversal. The opponent was the first in the league/48d946849f2a44b5bc461941505426f7.jpg" alt="Mitchell&#39;s mind is broken! Leonard scored 18 points in the last quarter to make a big reversal. The opponent was the first in the league"><br>In fact, today’s clippers don’t play well, even the first three quarters of little card’s own are very depressed. As the best defensive team in the league, jazz’s pressure on Leonard can be regarded as a textbook level. Four front lines: O’Neill, Bogdan, Jeff Green, Ingels, consume Leonard in turn. As long as Leonard catches the ball, he will fight physically, and Leonard is ready to fight When it comes to shooting, they’re all just Leonard’s eyes, not the basket!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Mitchell's mind is broken! Leonard scored 18 points in the last quarter to make a big reversal. The opponent was the first in the league/1b5c0e67367d4194b3c2523396f8de9e.jpg" alt="Mitchell&#39;s mind is broken! Leonard scored 18 points in the last quarter to make a big reversal. The opponent was the first in the league"><br>Kaka’s first three quarters are 4 out of 15 and 0 out of 6. What about the other teammates? Either shamet or zubates, they can score, but the Clippers are behind. The key is that their scores can’t suppress the opponent’s attack rhythm. It’s hard to pull the situation apart. But when Lewy and Harrell came on, things got better. Everything changed from the fourth quarter.<br>Luwei first assists Harrell in the air and hits, then Leonard receives Harrell’s hand-in-hand pass. Without any adjustment, he makes a three-point shot and hits! Next round Leonard jump shot, green make-up shot, followed by Leonard grabbed the backboard, another three-point chase! It’s not over yet. Next round, Leonard will face the opponent’s eye blocking operation, and make a difficult backward jump shot! Like Kobe! There Mitchell responds with a three, and Leonard scores another free throw line! In the next round, Harrell will make up for it again. The whole clipper’s morale will rise because of Leonard’s eight points in a row!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Mitchell's mind is broken! Leonard scored 18 points in the last quarter to make a big reversal. The opponent was the first in the league/06e075cbfc61417795dff9feacc6e2f5.jpg" alt="Mitchell&#39;s mind is broken! Leonard scored 18 points in the last quarter to make a big reversal. The opponent was the first in the league"><br>After that, including the scramble of harkles, the mid-range shooting of Ludwig and the fast ship gradually spread the difference. The Jazz really have no way! And Mitchell in the final mentality also collapsed, a time by hackers, a face Leonard, reluctantly, but also by the Clippers to protect the backboard, the game completely lost suspense!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Mitchell's mind is broken!

Leonard scored 18 points in the last quarter to make a big reversal. The opponent was the first in the league"><br>You should know that this jazz is the first defensive team in the League at present, losing only 94 points per game. The defensive efficiency is 95.4, which is also the first in the league. It’s difficult for any team to play climax against jazz, especially in the fourth quarter, when Mitchell scored 36 points and lost the game today, can he not be aggrieved? Bergdan played well. He scored 19 points against Leonard’s defense, but that’s it At a critical moment, Leonard changed the balance between jazz and Clippers! Leonard contributed 30 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals and 1 block, plus or minus + 16!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Mitchell's mind is broken!

    <title>Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being</title>
    <url>/2020/11/10/Nearly%2026%20points%20big%20reversal!%20Three%20times%20in%20six%20games,%20the%20biggest%20fake%20superstar%20in%20the%20east%20came%20into%20being/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season that ended on the morning of November 3, the Bucks played Raptors at home, 115-105, and the Bucks won! Last season, the eastern duel between the fate of the game, although the Raptors lost the little card and green, although the first section of the Bucks was 26 points ahead of the Raptors, but the Bucks were once again recovered 21 points! At present, the bucks are absolutely the top in the East in terms of strength, but it’s impossible for them to win any match smoothly, either in the first quarter, or in the first quarter, and the outcome is always more unexpected! Goodbye letter brother!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being/cee6277ef8514f06972d54873184efd3.jpg" alt="Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being"><br>In terms of data, for the Raptors, anunoby has 9 points and 4 assists, sikam has 16 points and 5 rebounds, with 10 points and 12 rebounds added, van freet has 12 points and 7 assists and 6 rebounds, Ibaka has 11 points, Lori has 36 points and 6 assists and 4 rebounds. On the Bucks’ side, brother Letterman has 36 points, 15 rebounds and 8 assists, Middleton has 11 points and 7 assists, Lopez has 11 points, bradso has 14 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being/fa6216fe21b54be793985cde154f5104.jpg" alt="Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being"><br>The process of the game is very twists and turns. In the first quarter, three points were scored by bradeso and seven points were scored by Goliath. After the climax of a wave of 12-2, the Raptors didn’t score in the game until five minutes later. After the Bucks came on the bench, they blossomed more points. The bucks in a single quarter led the Raptors by 36-17 points. In the second quarter, big Lopez scored two and three points. Brother alphabet scored four points after he went on the court. At one time, the difference was 26 points. The Raptors were awake. After Gasol and anunobi scored two and three points, the Raptors returned a wave of 23-10. At the end of the first half, the Bucks led the Raptors 66-50.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being/39d12dba17944ea388060d43e0511cfe.jpg" alt="Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being"><br>The Bucks went offline in the third quarter. Lori scored 2 + 1 points, sICAM scored 3 points, and Lori scored another 2 and 3 points. Although alphanum was also making the inside line after playing, Ibaka and sICAM were another 9-0 wave. Raptors successfully reduced the difference to only 5 points. In the fourth quarter, the Bucks did not dare to play big, and continued to play the main force. The attack of both sides was rare and sluggish, playing for 4 minutes. The two teams got 7 points in total, and the Raptors had several opportunities to level off or even surpass the score, but both Sika and Lori failed to grasp the opportunity. The end of the Raptors was dumb for 2 minutes. The three points of van fritt once let the Raptors see hope, but the four points of brother Letterman and Bradshaw Locked in the win, the score was set at 115-105.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being/0ed7ba2e37704296a1bc24ce6574a238.jpg" alt="Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being"><br>At present, the Bucks have played 6 games, 4-2, and the most terrible is that these two defeats were once more than 20 points ahead, and finally were brutally reversed! Come on, let’s count. On October 27, the Bucks played the heat. They really despised the heat. In the first three quarters, they were 21 points ahead of the heat. They almost locked in the win. They let the heat’s Winslow, Hiro, nane and others chase points and finish the anti super game! After entering extra time, the heat Adebayor and Dragic won 8 points, locked in the win!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being/6d1bc3d63fa6471196c1fd3454ceb0e5.jpg" alt="Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being"><br>On October 31, the Celtics played away and looked down on their opponents. In the second quarter, they were 40-21 ahead by 19 points, but in the second half, Celtic made a breakthrough. Heywood, Tatum and smart hit 5 consecutive 3 points. The three quarters didn’t end, and they were overtaken. In the fourth quarter, Bucks couldn’t pull back even if they wanted to. Finally, they lost 105-116!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being/62ac306453e84df18cefb9616083e8ac.jpg" alt="Nearly 26 points big reversal! Three times in six games, the biggest fake superstar in the east came into being"><br>Today, it’s the same again. If the Raptors fall into scoring shortage twice in the fourth quarter, the Bucks may lose the game again. Why is it so big? Think the regular season is boring, want to directly surpass all the opponents into the east? In fact, at this stage, the bucks are playing more and more irrationally. Middleton and Bradshaw can shoot three points, but after half-time, when their teammates are still in decline, they make too many direct shots, are hit back too many times, and the three-point team has a good feel. It may take two quarters to play the game, but for the Bucks, even if they are 20 points ahead, they are always ready May be overturned by the opponent!<br>Now the game process of bucks is that I beat you down first. If you can stand up, maybe I’ll lie down. If you can’t stand up, I’m going to wave! The biggest fake giant in the East was born.</p>

    <title>Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/Never%20do%20it%20again!%20James%20admits%20a%20mistake%20to%20the%20Lakers,%20and%20Vogel%20has%20a%20showdown/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Lakers won five straight games in a 103-96 win over the Spurs. LeBron James played 37 minutes in the game, 21 points, 11 rebounds, 13 assists, 2 steals and 1 block in 8 of 23 shots. It has to be said that James, who is 34 and about to be 35, can still maintain quite good data and physical condition. Take a look at the condition of thunder’s good brother Chris Paul, who is 34 years old. Paul is also working hard. But the physical side is not as good as James. Paul’s decline is obvious, especially the breakthrough side has no explosive power at all. James is still tough, even better than last season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown/1718999ec6484e9c94c39200fa0cc532.jpg" alt="Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown"><br>James suffered a serious groin injury last season, as you can see when Stephen curry suffered a groin injury a few years ago. How troublesome is the groin injury? It’s an injury that can only be maintained slowly and can’t be forced back. Last season, curry advised James that he’d better come back from injury, otherwise it will definitely interfere with you. It’s true that James’s forced comeback was so explosive that he didn’t take the Lakers to the playoffs.<br>James also talked about this today. He admitted a mistake to the Lakers. He shouldn’t come back with a groin injury last season, which can’t help the Lakers and influence the team.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown/203461ab8c9042dc96493f342dae8655.jpg" alt="Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown"><br>James said: “a lot of people have said that my defense has improved a lot this season, especially my moving speed. I want to say that because I didn’t play with injuries like I did last season. I’m not hurt, so my speed and strength are coming back and I’m improving myself. I shouldn’t be playing with a torn groin, even if there was a partial tear in that muscle when I came back. I’ve influenced the team on the defensive side, I can’t move and turn as fast as I used to, everything is falling. I feel really good this season, thanks to Davis, I’ve been looking for him in training, just to get my move back. Of course, that’s why my basketball mind is always there<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown/3789069f5ce145cfb1d7c2dc9a096f0f.jpg" alt="Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown"><br>It’s worth mentioning that after the game, Lakers coach Frank Vogel also named James for his defense. Even though the Lakers coach last season was not Vogel but Walton. But Vogel has been watching last season’s Lakers video, he thinks James has improved defense, especially his body is obviously better than last season.<br>Vogel believes that when a superstar is so involved in the defensive end, everyone in the team will be infected, and they can see that from the game scene. Vogel’s showdown. James has a very good attitude.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown/b3201bf1360947d1bb16a6c0dd176863.jpg" alt="Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown"><br>That’s the difference between LeBron James and another James, who basically has the ball. A person threw a cool, which led to teammates have little enthusiasm. It’s basically four people watching one person playing on the court, no fun. In addition, another James on the defensive side is very lazy. Today’s heat game is basically a killing caused by eye defense. When the boss doesn’t love defense, how can other people get infected?<br>Like Howard, why is he so fragrant now? In the final analysis, Howard has an attitude, that is, he is conscientious in defense.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown/f08063e240424c33b6c8e1bc657cb1b7.jpg" alt="Never do it again! James admits a mistake to the Lakers, and Vogel has a showdown"><br>Finally, let’s talk about the groin. Some fans may not know what the injury is. Groin is an important part connecting abdomen and thigh. Being close to James, he is often regarded as a part of privacy. Once this part is injured, a stretch will cause severe pain. It’s only through slow maintenance that there is no need for surgery. It’s a small injury. After all, it’s a complete recovery without affecting James’s happiness.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of November 6, an NBA regular season game ended. The eagles met the Spurs at home. The eagles did not have a good time recently. They lost three times in a row after two wins. General Trey young was injured and just came back. Collins, the team’s No.2 scoring point, was banned for 25 games. It’s hard! Today, I played in Spurs. In the first half, Trey young only got one point with a free throw. But in the second half, I couldn’t control it. Either Murray or white, they all won Trey Young’s free throw in the half! 108-100, Hawks beat Spurs at home, Popovich is helpless!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One in the first half and 28 in the second! Popovich has no choice. Who can control trejan/890a5562439a4097be6b026df2282a03.jpg" alt="One in the first half and 28 in the second! Popovich has no choice. Who can control trejan"><br>In terms of data, the hawk side, Hunter’s 16 points and 8 rebounds, Parker’s 19 points and 8 rebounds, redish’s 12 points and 3 rebounds, trejan’s 29 points and 13 assists and 2 steals, and Carter’s 7 points. On the Spurs side, drozan scored 22 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, Adelaide 14 points, 5 rebounds, Forbes 17 points, 2 rebounds and mills 16 points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One in the first half and 28 in the second! Popovich has no choice. Who can control trejan/a1f547ac6e0c400194c404a2412d3e25.jpg" alt="One in the first half and 28 in the second! Popovich has no choice. Who can control trejan"><br>Throughout the first half, the eagles played too hard, spurs deliberately slow rhythm, eagles are difficult to play fast offensive and defensive conversion, drozan and Adelaide score continuously, and the eagles rely on Parker and redish score barely to maintain the difference, the first quarter, eagles should county 1 point, but Trey young no feel! In the second quarter, the two sides began to fight in disorder, with only two points in the first three minutes. Then the Spurs hit a wave of 6-0 climax with drozan and Forbes. Forbes scored another three points, while the Hawks relied on redish to bite the score, but the rhythm was the Spurs’. At the end of the first half, the Spurs led by one point. The whole first half, trejan 8 0!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One in the first half and 28 in the second! Popovich has no choice. Who can control trejan/bbec9e14cd654a8ca44c918313bd8fd5.jpg" alt="One in the first half and 28 in the second! Popovich has no choice. Who can control trejan"><br>In the second half, drozan and Adelaide still couldn’t hold back, but the difference was that trejan opened his hand, broke through the emergency stop jump shot, and caused White’s foul. Then the Spurs hit a three-point shot under the leadership of mills, 7-0 climax! And Trey Yang is also a hundred, single section contribution 12 points! The Spurs are still seven points ahead. In the last section, Trey young is unreasonable. Against Murray’s defense, he just shot two steps ahead of the midline. Go ahead! Next round, Xu Erte will come on, and enter! The hawk leveled the difference, and then it broke out completely. Xu Erte and Trey young, you and I have been in the rain one by one. Carter also won in the middle. The Spurs didn’t have a temper. In the last minute, Trey young broke through the board and hit. Then the three-point ball locked the winner, 108-100, and the Spurs lost like this!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One in the first half and 28 in the second! Popovich has no choice.

In the first half, under the defense of Murray and white, Trey young could not even pass the ball, but in the second half, it became Jordan? It’s worth mentioning that the Spurs don’t believe in evil. Today they have three times more than the eagles. But from Forbes to guy to white, all of them are not allowed. In the fourth quarter, when the eagles had been raining for three minutes, the internal scoring on their side was gone, and the Spurs were in a mess.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One in the first half and 28 in the second!

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 6, the NBA regular season hawks took their home game against the Spurs. Trey young is finally back today, but the bad news is that Collins, the team’s top player, has been banned from 25 games by the League for violating the NBA drug ban. It’s a wave of ups and downs. For the Spurs, it’s a good chance to bounce back and improve their rankings. However, in the end, the Hawks finally beat the Spurs 108-100 with trejan’s crazy performance in the second half, ending the three consecutive defeats.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One point in the first half, 28 points in the second half. Trey young broke through the Spurs' defense by himself. It was crazy/8cbf160822f54b89b331c39fc5c48a5a.jpg" alt="One point in the first half, 28 points in the second half.

Trey young has played the all star level data of 26.8 points, 7.3 assists and 5 rebounds per game. Collins has also made remarkable progress in this season. He can contribute 17 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2 blocks per game. The team has also made a perfect start of 2 consecutive wins. However, when it was believed that the Hawks could not hold on to take off, trejan sprained his ankle, and then Collins was banned. The team suffered three consecutive defeats, casting a shadow over Atlanta.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One point in the first half, 28 points in the second half.

Trey young broke through the Spurs&#39; defense by himself. It was crazy"><br>This game is very important for the eagles, if they lose again, it may even affect their positioning of the season. But in spite of this, Trey young, who was eager to come back from the game, was not in a good attacking state. He lost all the first eight shots and got only one point from the free throw in the first half. He was obviously worried about the injury. However, his field of vision, his Haunted passing (eight assists in the half), still can provide a lot of help to the team.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One point in the first half, 28 points in the second half.

It was crazy"><br>Spurs in the face of young young young eagles, did not get the advantage of the scene, play very dull, the outside line crazy iron, the inside Aldrich also performance in general, in the face of young inside Lynn, but repeatedly eat flat, the first half of 8-vote only 2, fortunately, mills and drozan performance is stable. In the first half, both teams were extremely inefficient in attack, with the Spurs leading by only one point 45-44.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One point in the first half, 28 points in the second half.

Trey young broke through the Spurs&#39; defense by himself. It was crazy"><br>Yi Bian fought again, which became Trey Young’s performance time. In the third quarter, he made 5-for-5 shots, breaking the scoring shortage in the sports war and helping the team to hold the score. When the eagles were 8 points behind in the last quarter of the final showdown, it was still Trey young who came out. He scored 3 points in a row, setting off an 11-0 scoring climax with his own strength, which was totally unstoppable. The Spurs have to adopt the strategy of bag and clip. Even when Trey young doesn’t hold the ball, the Spurs are heavily defensive. No matter what, Trey young can still find out the mobile phone meeting in a crack. At the end of the day, he scored 16 points and killed the suspense of the game directly!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/One point in the first half, 28 points in the second half.

In the first half, 1 point was scored, and in the second half, 28 points was too crazy. At the end of the game, Trevor scored 29 points, 13 assists, 2 rebounds and 2 steals in 10 of 23 shots, declaring his strong return. His competition with dongqiqi is not over.</p>

    <title>Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/Roar%2040%20+%205%20+%205!%20But%20the%20pelican%20made%20Ingram%20cold,%20and%20only%20Zion%20was%20in%20his%20heart/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the pelican lost 125-135 to the nets. Ingram became the protagonist of the game, he played 37 minutes, 24-for-17, got 40 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals. Although he couldn’t lead the pelican to victory, Ingram did his best. He worked hard to drive his teammates and compete with Owen. If it weren’t for Ingram to hold on to the pelicans today, they would have collapsed. And Ingram was not afraid of Owen, he did not lose.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/98d40d1631664e8284acdee9e87f8ad0.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>It is worth mentioning that Ingram’s performance has also become the first person in the history of pelicans. He scored 181 points in the first seven games, exceeding demarchus cousins’ 155 points, ranking first in history. In this season, Ingram can get the data of 26 + 7 + 3 in 32 games per game, with a hit rate of 55.2%, a three-point hit rate of 48.6%, and an average of 2.4 three-points per game.<br>There is no doubt that the Los Angeles Lakers gave the pelican not a low-end Durant, but a young Durant. Durant, a 22-year-old who is younger than some rookies, is already in his fourth season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/278a7b48f74444018e1d93279c0286b5.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>Durant also hugged and talked with Ingram after today’s game. It’s worth mentioning that Ingram’s height is no different from Durant’s. In the previous official height of pelicans, Ingram’s barefoot is only 2.01 meters, while Durant’s barefoot is 2.08 meters. How do pelicans measure their height? The difficulty is to measure Ingram’s hunchback? Ingram’s official height was 2.06 meters when he was in the Lakers. Today, his height is almost 2.06 meters compared with Durant’s, slightly shorter than Durant’s.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/7581bb37a0ab413ba21afc2a8eb4bd50.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>But just when everyone thought Ingram would become the pelican’s new boss, manager Jim Terry’s comments on Ingram after the game were chilling. He thinks Ingram can’t be the pelican’s boss even if he plays like this.<br>“From a player’s point of view, Ingram is a person who will try his best to help the team win the game,” he said. But from the perspective of leadership, I don’t think Ingram can be a leader yet. We’re still looking for someone who can stand up. Of course, hollerdy is an excellent leader, but we still want to find a more suitable leader, a player who can really lead the team   “<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/0877e11a23b240fdb67cb68293be395b.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>Kim Terry’s meaning is self-evident. It’s still Zion Williams. Who else can he say? Ingram has no problem with his skills, but not with his leadership. And hollerdy has leadership, but not enough skills. So the pelican’s choice is Zion. Of course, if we give the pelican a dongqiqi, we don’t need to say anything.<br>But it’s definitely not good news for Ingram, who played so hard but still couldn’t get the pelican’s heart.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart/f2b4f5da0b3c4099acb63b8cffbcc5b2.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 5 + 5! But the pelican made Ingram cold, and only Zion was in his heart"><br>Is Zion great? He is less than 2 meters tall and weighs 127 kg, which his knee can’t bear at all. After losing weight, Zion is not like a player. Is Zion really more suitable to be the team leader than Ingram?</p>

    <title>Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, Denver Nuggets ended their winning streak with a 109-89 home win over the heat, kicking the heat from first place in the East. This game Nuggets really show the strength of the championship, they reach the realm of free play. Especially in the first half, nuggets and heat played slowly, but in the second half, Nuggets finished a strong harvest. They showed their defensive ability, especially the Nuggets’ strong front team caused great pressure on Butler. The Nuggets have been poor in the past few years, but this summer they got grant from the thunder to fill the last gap.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship/ea8ac24909414e6986822d1777d57436.jpg" alt="Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship"><br>Nuggets are now rich in front, with grant and button and former top pick Michael Porter. In addition, Millsap and Craig are excellent. Today, the Nuggets are also in a good way. They still beat the heat without the help of joachic. Denver Nuggets showed great offensive ability from the beginning of the first quarter. Murray and button won 5 points in a row.<br>Jokic also began his own performance, first frequently for his teammates to send good shots, then jump shot hit. Nuggets start strong. And the heat side of Butler’s first quarter is very brave. After a break of 2 + 1, Butler made free throws and scored 4 points in a row. The Nuggets led the heat by one point in the first quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship/8613d7891f8c481cb35fdf4c34786ab7.jpg" alt="Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship"><br>In the second quarter, grant started to work with the second team. He first scored 2 points with his long arm under the basket, and then grant made a breakthrough in the 2 + 1 strong play. Nuggets made a 12-0 run under his leadership. The heat can only rely on Butler to stop bleeding, he hit the basket again to make free throws, and No. 13 rookie Hiro also scored in a slam dunk. The Nuggets took the lead by 10 points, 58-48, at half-time.<br>In the second half, I thought the heat would start to fight back, but it was one-sided. Denver Nuggets went crazy, and Jokic + Murray + grant + pramley hit two waves of 8-0 offensive frenzy. Grant was the first three points in a row, with the Nuggets leading by 21 points in the third quarter.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship/2f2d694a7f5f46d3bcdcd1f136ca52de.jpg" alt="Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship"><br>The heat tried to fight back at the end of the game, but Denver didn’t give them a chance. They started with 8-2 to pull the difference from 21 to 28, killing the game directly. Jimmy Butler had a bad feeling in the whole game. He got 16 points, 7 boards, 4 assists and 3 breaks, but he shot only 12 in 3. Butler today spent most of his time on free throws, 10 out of 12. In addition, the heat’s Leonard scored 10 points, nane 11 points, Adebayor is not in shape, 2 out of 9 scored 6 points.<br>In terms of nuggets, Barton scored 15 points and 10 boards, Murray scored 21 points, Jokic scored 9 points and 5 boards in 4 of 12, helped 4 mistakes, the whole court was a bit listless, and asked the teacher to be lazy again. Grant scored 15 points, including 6 of 13 shots and 2 3-pointers.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship/4e778d8c186c493aa8eb69ea778b43d5.jpg" alt="Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship"><br>It has to be said that nuggets are perfect now. Their weak front with Grant has basically become a team without loopholes. Grant is a young Paul George. Last season grant played an incredible performance, he played 80 games (77 starts), 32.7 minutes per game, 13.6 points 5.2 rebounds 1.25 blocks. Grant is 2.03 meters tall and has a terrifying 2.20-meter arm span.<br>It can only be said that the thunder sent out a young version of George has affected the situation in the west, so that the Lakers have a strong impact on the championship.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship/3d94a90b1f2e48d89a6b25dad3ea313d.jpg" alt="Roar 15 + 5 vs. drag Butler, little George Lost by thunder, which makes the Lakers another strong opponent in the championship"><br>Thunder is a pity, in order to save money and send grant away, if thunder keep grant with Chris Paul and Alexander, they can make it to the playoffs, and even the Western Conference finals. Thunder is fourth in the defensive League this season, losing 101.8 points per game is still suffocating.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>A NBA regular game ended in the morning of November 9th. Pelican fighting for Raptors at home, the final score was 104-122, Pelican lost again, for pelican, losing is already commonplace, but the way of losing is exactly the same, inside defense has become a big problem. Once upon a time, Pelican once sat on Randall, mirotich, Davis, known as the league’s strongest internal portfolio, now, a mess.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/SICAM is crazy! Slash 44 + 10 to crush Yingge, and the position at the end of the Western billboard is locked in advance/2a6ac5904e814b798bc5bc9bbc162ce2.jpg" alt="SICAM is crazy! Slash 44 + 10 to crush Yingge, and the position at the end of the Western billboard is locked in advance"><br>Data, Pelican side, Ingram 27 points 7 rebounds, Holliday 16 points 6 assists, Jackson 13 points, Walker 13 points 4 assists. On the Raptors’ side, anunuobi scored 21 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists, sikam played 39 minutes, slashed 44 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists, and van fried scored 12 points and 11 assists.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/SICAM is crazy!

Slash 44 + 10 to crush Yingge, and the position at the end of the Western billboard is locked in advance"><br>In the first quarter, sICAM went crazy! Break through the high throw, break through the layup to make 2 + 1, stop the jump shot, turn around the small hook, raptors in the first 15 points, 13 points from Sika! And the pelican’s Yingge also gave a continuous response, including the outside line 3 + 1, Holliday’s three points, fevos’s make-up, the two sides tied 30 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, raptors rely on Lori and Powell’s wave of 13-0 to open the gap, while in Yingge’s rest, the pelican did not get a point! The Raptors have pulled the difference to 20 in the half.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/SICAM is crazy!

Slash 44 + 10 to crush Yingge, and the position at the end of the Western billboard is locked in advance"><br>In the third quarter, van freett also found two and three points in his hand. Ingram slammed the basket to stop bleeding, but at this time, the Raptors had blossomed a lot, and the low position of West Asia turned into his unique skill. Anunobi also made a continuous mid shot, and the Raptors once opened the difference to 29 points. There was almost no suspense in the fourth quarter. Although the pelican once reduced the score to 15 points, anunobi’s three points killed the game at the last moment. The score was set at 104-122!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/SICAM is crazy!

Slash 44 + 10 to crush Yingge, and the position at the end of the Western billboard is locked in advance"><br>Last month, cicham and raptors reached a four-year $130 million extension. There is no doubt that after Leonard’s departure, raptors will build a team around him in the future. In the four seasons of raptors, sikam’s growth curve can only be found in the game. When he first came to the Raptors, he averaged 4.2 points + 3.4 rebounds per game, and in the second season, he averaged 7.3 points + 4.5 rebounds per game. Last season, with Leonard’s help, sikam grew rapidly, contributing 16.9 + 6.9 data per game. After Leonard said goodbye to the Raptors, sikam has developed a combination of attack and defense, using various methods He has been promoted to the first-line star with 27.9 points and 9 rebounds per game this season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/SICAM is crazy!

Slash 44 + 10 to crush Yingge, and the position at the end of the Western billboard is locked in advance"><br>For pelicans, they are in a very awkward situation. Lang Xi’an, the number one pick, has a talent explosion, and people are looking forward to it. But in summer, there are some worries because of injuries. The new season has not yet started, and it is serious injury, and it will take a long time to return. The three players from the Lakers trade, Hart has gradually faded out of the rotation position, the ball elder brother has lost the spirit in the Lakers, now only willing to try three points, the series team effect is not good. While Ingram can contribute 25 + data per game, it’s hard to compare the defensive end with Durant. Today, he is completely crushed by sICAM, and the pelican has the taste of playing empty.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/SICAM is crazy! Slash 44 + 10 to crush Yingge, and the position at the end of the Western billboard is locked in advance/b2ec3c39e2d44de2b41ba98e750de60f.jpg" alt="SICAM is crazy! Slash 44 + 10 to crush Yingge, and the position at the end of the Western billboard is locked in advance"><br>At present, pelican’s record is 1-7. If it hasn’t improved, I’m afraid it will fight for the number one pick next year.</p>

In the fourth quarter, besmore’s three points, Simmons’s counter attack, the Blazers once drew the warriors, but Pascal broke out again, three-point ball, foul making, under the basket slam dunk, a wave of 15-2 completely locked the winner, warriors home 127-118 beat the Blazers!

The brave new Durant was born, green was slapped again, the brave welcomed the good"><br>Green is absent, Cole puts Pascal in position 4. Compared with green, Pascal is much better. In the first quarter, he scored 17 points on drallard and dabaibian, and scored 3-of-3 goals, which attracted Curie’s praise on the social platform: he is another level now, I like it very much! Pascal’s value is not only reflected in scoring, his attack is too comprehensive, there are three points, there is an independent attack, there is a shot! Driven by Pascal, Bowman also broke out. He connected the team and made a breakthrough, including two substitutes, boks and Damian Lee. This warrior is more like a whole.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Second win of the season!

How does green play?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Second win of the season!

Russell, who was absent from two games due to ankle injury, is expected to return to play a red team in the west the day after tomorrow. Now he is on the daily watch list, but there is no specific news including Rooney and green.</p>

    <title>Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/Six%20million%20a%20year&#39;s%20salary%20can&#39;t%20be%20kept.%20The%2025-year-old%20giant%20is%20fighting%20for%2043%20+%2012.%20You&#39;re%20in%20a%20dilemma/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Los Angeles Clippers avenged jazz 105-94 at home today. The main character of today’s game is undoubtedly Leonard. Today, Xiao Ka is wandering between hell and heaven. Leonard became a blacksmith in the first half. But he broke out in the second half, especially in the last quarter when he scored 18 points to break the jazz. Leonard has become the king of the last quarter of the season, averaging 12.6 points in the last quarter, temporarily ranking first in the league.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/f1bea7a1b3ca4cc18d3389c95be4f10b.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>The Clippers are currently third in the West with a 5-2 record, with Leonard playing six games. It has to be said that Leonard joined the Clippers seamlessly. He is not the same as some superstars who hold the ball wildly and play by themselves, because Leonard does not need a lot of players to hold the ball, so the players of the clippers have the right to control the ball, which increases their enthusiasm invisibly.<br>After all, what’s the point of watching four people play by themselves, playing outside and shooting? At the end of the day, basketball is still a five person sport, and Leonard explains it perfectly. And it’s very tough, and it’s always on the line<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/f61d8740f4084d789b0c737d950a7492.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>The most important thing is that Leonard has invested a lot of energy in the defensive side, and he never throws too much when his hand is not good. After today’s game, Leonard talked about the team’s winning when he said that he felt bad in the first half, but he tried to give everything on the defensive side. Leonard also praised the defense of his teammates, which can limit a team’s score to less than 100 points, which shows the face of the team itself.<br>In addition to Leonard, today the Clippers also grabbed 16 offensive rebounds, their total rebounds compared to the Jazz: 54-37, won 14. Of the eight rebounds that Harrell grabbed, six were offensive rebounds, and old rivers was named for praise.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/7a3442ea85ba4813a709f540b43054fd.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>Today, Harrell played 30 minutes and got 19 points, 8 rebounds and 2 assists. It is worth mentioning that in the last game, Harrell also scored 24 + 4. Harrell scored 43 + 12 in two games, with 16 out of 21 shooting.<br>In the seven games this season, Harrell can get 19.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 2 assists in an average of 28 minutes, with a hit rate of 73.6%. He has not made three points. Harrell, who earned $6 million this season, signed a $12 million two-year contract with the Clippers in the summer of 18, which expires in the summer of 20.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/3215ec6a67d14b3ea700f35171651f4f.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>Harrell, 25, was born in 1994. There is no doubt that the contract year of Harrell has ushered in the outbreak. For clippers, 6 million a year’s salary may not be retained, at least 10 million a year’s salary is needed. Harrell’s annual salary of 20 million is certainly unrealistic. After all, he is too short and has no long-range shooting ability. The defensive end can’t be used as the big gate of the team and the small guard of the outside line. In terms of positioning, Harrell is a dream green who ends up in the basket without passing the ball.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/4daded5896194bb288c2263fd55da025.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>If Harrell is 2.08 meters tall, he is certainly worth 20 million annual salary, or even 30 million. For the time being, the Clippers are in trouble. It depends on how much Harrell will charge next summer, because Beverly has won a three-year 40 million contract this summer. Harrell is certainly not content with a six million year salary.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six million a year's salary can't be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You're in a dilemma/05b91e88b303443b986dbed153ba3ef1.jpg" alt="Six million a year&#39;s salary can&#39;t be kept. The 25-year-old giant is fighting for 43 + 12. You&#39;re in a dilemma"><br>In terms of the team’s position, the clippers can’t be short of Harrell. He is an important member on the bench. He can play 1 + 1 and surpass 2 with Ludwig. If Harrell can’t stay, the threat of Ludwig will be reduced a lot, and the two are complementary.</p>

    <title>Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos/6d96e0bdd8d24e6cb2fb2c516b4b3e85.jpg" alt="Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos"><br>On the morning of November 10, an NBA regular season ended, the Spurs played Celtic at home. For Celtic, after the Spurs’ hard bone gnawed, the following schedule was relatively easy, and they returned to the home to wait for work. 115-135, spurs home defeat, Celtic won seven consecutive! Similar to the Lakers this season, the first game of the season, a complete defeat! After the game, win! It’s worth mentioning that Walker’s excellent performance has made Celtic fans forget Owen completely. Compared with Owen, Walker is obviously more rational, and the East is a bit chaotic.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos/597d5e40fd0041daaebb838097483d29.jpg" alt="Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos"><br>In today’s game with the Spurs, Hayward injured his left hand in the match with Adelaide. He only played 15 minutes in the first half and got 9 points and 2 rebounds. Then he took the initiative to apply for leaving. Only after an examination did he find out that his left hand was broken! The situation is similar to that of Curie. It’s not clear how long the truce will take. However, Hayward’s Celtic career is also very difficult. When he joined, he was seriously injured for one year. When he came back, he didn’t even have the main position. Now that Owen is gone, Hayward’s ball power is gradually increasing. In the first seven games of the season, Hayward can get 20.3 points + 7.9 rebounds + 4.6 assists per game. The latest news is that Hayward will meet with experts on Monday local time to decide whether surgery is needed.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos/9209b992df3a48368be895ab4618c32d.jpg" alt="Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos"><br>Hayward was injured, but it didn’t affect the overall outbreak of Celtic. After a period of absence, Jerry Brown felt hot in the game, contributing 12 points in a single quarter, and scoring 30 points and 7 rebounds in the whole game. The combination of brown and Walker in the backcourt made the Spurs’ Murray and Forbes exhausted. Today, the Spurs made too many mistakes and were robbed 11 times by Celtic. However, in the face of the Spurs’ combination of adelais and lairs, including brown, Tatum and walker, the Spurs could not cope with them.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos/5e1d7a0f635a4db99f57189b15b70985.jpg" alt="Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos"><br>Compared with last season, Celtic have been improved in quality this season. Walker didn’t perform well in the first two games of the season, because he wanted to prove himself too much, but then Walker took the initiative to adjust his playing methods and reduce the ball power. When Brown was absent, Walker spent more time as a sharp striker in the inner line. When the opponent felt hot, he would take the initiative to find his teammates. But after Brown returns, Walker becomes a shooter, opens the team attack space, the effect is obvious.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos/ea48478c9e0844bfac7ff64052b5f191.jpg" alt="Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos"><br>Walker averaged 24.3 points + 5.1 rebounds + 4 assists + 1 steals this season, while Owen averaged 23.8 points + 5 rebounds + 6.9 assists last season. The most significant change is that Walker dared to release the ball when he was on the court, and more Celtic players actively participated in the attack. On the defensive end, Walker also liberated Smart’s pressure. Smart’s average this season is 10.2 + 3.8 + 4.7, with obvious progress.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos/6dd7083e6b9c42edb331fbbddc0d852c.jpg" alt="Seven winning streak! Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos"><br>Celtic this season low open high walk, the first game, 14 points complete defeat 76 people, then all the way crazy, back-to-back continuous defeat raptors and Knicks, followed by 19 points at home to beat bucks, then beat Knicks, Cavaliers, Hornets and Spurs, at present 7-1 high in the East first, and the Lakers match!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Seven winning streak!

Los Angeles rivals top the Eastern Conference, with 140 million players replacing Owen perfectly. The eastern conference is in chaos"><br>In fact, ESPN at the beginning of the season for Celtic prediction, that their strength in the bucks and 76 people, after all, Owen and Horford have left, Walker’s running in degree is also a problem, but did not expect Celtic to quickly complete the team running in, all the way, the pressure raptors, heat, bucks, 76 people ranked first in the East, the East is also chaotic!</p>

    <title>The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/The%20200%20million%20combination%20was%20knocked%20out,%20Thompson%20was%20depressed,%20Lefu%20was%20subdued,%20give%20the%20knight%20Dong%20Qiqi%20to%20get%20into%20the%20total%20decision/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of today’s game, the Cavaliers lost to lone Rangers 111-131 at home. This game is too hard for the Cavaliers. We feel for the first time that LeBron James has been so influential since he left. The reason is that Luka Dongqi’s performance, the performance of the 20-year-old superstar, makes the Cavaliers envy him very much. If the Cavaliers could be top scorers or scouts in the past few years, they would certainly be interested in dongqiqi. Unfortunately, the Cavaliers only got the 8th place in the basket, and the latest choice was sexton.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision/502acfd8d18347bca660499545081f41.jpg" alt="The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision"><br>It has to be said that the gap between Sexton and dongqiqi is too big. The first five ranks of the 18th are really crouching tigers and hidden dragons. The champion Lang Aiton has fulfilled his talent, and the second ranking Barkley has played well in the king. Dongqiqi in the third place has become a superstar, and Jarun Jackson in the fourth place has also grown up in Grizzlies. Trey young in the fifth place has also played a superstar performance this season.<br>At present, dongqiqi’s talent and strength are the first in the 18th, and Trey young is the second. But the upper limit for Dongqi is higher because Dongqi is tall.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision/152cce914d2943f88af1d1d7c01a6cfa.jpg" alt="The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision"><br>Dongqiqi’s height can make his peak period long enough, while Trey Young’s height is not enough. Although both of them have played superstar performance now, Trey Young’s falling speed and upper limit are certainly not as good as dongqiqi’s. It’s also better for dongqiqi.<br>In today’s game, dongqiqi played 34 minutes, scoring 29 points, 14 rebounds and 15 assists. Let Cavalier’s boss Kevin love take it all, the Knights selected Sexton + this year’s garland and Porter, together are not as good as a East chip. When Lefu talked about dongqiqi, he was very envious that the lone ranger had this cornerstone. How good would it be if dongqiqi was a knight?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision/ccafe3ff01564875a9a16625eac51c63.jpg" alt="The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision"><br>Loew said: “I really think Dongqi is the future face of the league. His performance is unbelievable. I was surprised by his performance last season and didn’t want to take him to a new level in the new season. He had a lot of influence. In the fourth quarter, when I sat on the sidelines, I looked at dongqiqi’s technical statistics and thought, “brother, this is the most silent 29 points, 15 assists and 14 rebounds I have ever seen in my life. He looks like a magician. You can’t describe him in more words! “<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision/ba9ad035ba0343cc873ae6bc3fc8d6f5.jpg" alt="The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision"><br>In today’s game, Lefu played 36 minutes, scoring 29 points, 8 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steals and tries his best. Thompson also got 11 points and 12 boards. This 200 million combination was really conquered by Dongqi’s performance today<br>Cleveland coach John bellein was also impressed with donchech in his post match interview, only to say that he admired him. If the Cavaliers are lucky enough to get the top three draft picks after James leaves and pick Middle East Chichi, can they make it to the Finals again? Even if you can’t make it to the finals, is it OK for the Cavaliers to make it to the playoffs? Compared with dongqiqi, who has the influence of a superstar, the Cavaliers are just short of a backbone and a boss.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision/ac2f24d9852b4d8ba06e21dd4ab1bb23.jpg" alt="The 200 million combination was knocked out, Thompson was depressed, Lefu was subdued, give the knight Dong Qiqi to get into the total decision"><br>Cleveland’s current lineup has retained LeBron James’s ability to reach the finals, Thompson and Loew Fook, as well as Osman. On the bench were NANs and Clarkson, only Jr Smith left. Unfortunately, I can only say that the lone ranger is so lucky. After using Nowitzki for more than ten years, he got a new cornerstone, Dongqi, and brought polzingis.</p>

    <title>Six wins in a row! Howard opens his mouth and promises, and James quietly makes a big contribution</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Lakers beat the bulls 118-112 away from home today. They were 17 points behind and won 6 consecutive games. LeBron James played an excellent performance in this game, he slashed 30 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists, 2 steals and 1 covers. With Davis not playing well in the first half, James struggled to support the Lakers. The good thing is that the rest of the Laker players gave support, Howard + Kuzma + Cook + kaluso exploded in the last quarter, the team played a 16-0 attack wave to reverse the bulls, James and Davis also finished the harvest later.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six wins in a row! Howard opens his mouth and promises, and James quietly makes a big contribution/e1b9fbb4902848d3b8483663384e8bf1.jpg" alt="Six wins in a row! Howard opens his mouth and promises, and James quietly makes a big contribution"><br>Howard was very good today. He played 24 minutes, made 3 of 4 shots, got 6 points, 6 rebounds and 1 cover. Among them, the positive and negative aspects and the other three get a total of + 26. Howard’s physical fitness began to recover at the offensive end, and his influence at the defensive end of today inspired the morale of the Lakers. It can be said that Howard was the shield for the Lakers at the end of today, and Kuzma and cook became the spears of the Lakers.<br>Cook scored 17 points today and Kuzma got 15 points and 4 rebounds. Compared with the slow movement of Howard in the pre-season, now his physical fitness is slowly recovering, bounce and speed are returning, not only can he defend the big man under the basket, but also the small guard. Howard began to become the best defender in the League for the 2008-09 season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six wins in a row! Howard opens his mouth and promises, and James quietly makes a big contribution/574616066e3a4bfe9eb143cbdb945afd.jpg" alt="Six wins in a row! Howard opens his mouth and promises, and James quietly makes a big contribution"><br>It is worth mentioning that after today’s game, Howard also practiced pull ups in the strength room. The attitude of the whole person is different from that of the previous years. It can be said that the experience of the past two years has made Howard understand the true meaning of the alliance. Only health is everything, only the body is your greatest capital.<br>Howard’s attendance has plummeted in the past two seasons, with only seven appearances at the Wizards last season. Joining the Lakers this summer, Howard kept asking James for advice on how to maintain his body, and finally it worked.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six wins in a row!

Howard opens his mouth and promises, and James quietly makes a big contribution"><br>Howard said after today’s game that he changed his diet when he joined the Lakers. He believed that health is the greatest wealth.<br>“When I was young, I thought my body would make me fight like that forever,” Howard said. So I did not control myself, but indulged myself. I eat fried chicken, chicken wings and honey bread every day. I didn’t cherish myself until my body began to age and my body made me feel worse than before, when I began to wake up. I realize the importance of taking good care of my body. Especially after I joined the Lakers, I began to understand that health is wealth<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/Six wins in a row!

Howard opens his mouth and promises, and James quietly makes a big contribution"><br>It can be said that Howard has been waiting for two years and finally woke up when he was on the verge of retirement due to injury crisis. Now he can vent. It’s a showdown against the League after two years, and he’s back on top.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Los Angeles Lakers beat the bulls 118-112 in six straight wins. It was a surprise because the Lakers were 17 points behind in the first half. 48-65 behind. In particular, Davies is in a very bad condition today, he only got 4 points, 2 boards and 2 assists in the first half. James scored 16 points, 8 boards and 4 assists in the first half, but the Lakers were suppressed. The bulls were in great shape in the first half today, they hit 54.3%. In the first half, Kobe white scored 16 points against James. Raven and Potter also scored 22 points in the half.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news.

James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>Just when all the fans thought the Lakers were gone, they finished the Jedi counterattack in the second half. In the third quarter, the Lakers did not finish the big chase, they hit 32-28 attack wave in a single quarter, only reducing the difference of 17 points to 13 points. But the Lakers went crazy in the fourth quarter, especially with Kuzma and Howard and cook, who exploded at the same time in the fourth quarter. In just four minutes, the Lakers started a strong 16-0 game. They were 13 points behind to 96-93.<br>Among them, Kuzma scored 9 points, Howard scored under the basket in a row, and the defense end was aggressive, while cook hit long-range shots in a row. At that time, the Lakers didn’t have James or Davis in the lineup.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news.

James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>But it was a group of bench bandits who played a wave of frenzy. In fact, this is not a game, but several games. The Lakers’ bench has become the trump card of James and Davis. After the Lakers made the big reversal, James and Davis both returned to the court and continued to play high. Kuzma made a mid-range shot, balman bacaluso finished the steals at the defensive end and scored 2 + 1 in the fast break. Cook then received a pass from James to hit three points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news.

James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>Howard slammed under the basket again, and James became the commander, delivering ammunition frequently and shooting in the critical moment. Davis also completed an air contact. The Lakers hit 38-19 in the last quarter. 11 points ahead in the last minute and it’s rubbish time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news.

Reserve ace cook 17 points 4 boards, Kuzma 15 points 4 boards, Howard 6 points 6 boards, bald Mamba 7 points 3 boards. The Lakers’ backup trump four have scored 45 points and 17 boards, which is a great success for the Lakers to win today.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news.

James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>It’s good news for LeBron James to have such a bench gangster. Like the clippers, why do they often make a big reversal when the starting performance is not good? It’s because the Clippers are tough substitutes. The combination of Luwei and Harrell can overcome the difficulties. The Lakers now have their own trump team, especially the Howard Lakers. And today, the annual salary of the four Lakers substitutes is only over 10 million yuan. The price is 45 + 17. The Lakers are laughing.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The Lakers won six games in a row and won good news.

James welcomed the 45 + 17 trumps with an annual salary of 10 million"><br>Of course, the Lakers have another piece of bad news. In the first part of today’s third quarter, Pope accidentally twisted his foot when he was ready to return to defense after making a three pointer. I don’t know what’s going on. It’s upsetting. Pop played well today. 21 minutes with 8 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assists.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended at noon on November 6, Denver Nuggets won the heat 109-89 at home. For the heat, it’s a bit difficult to adapt from warm Miami to the cold Denver plateau. The team is not online! However, this game also shows the Nuggets’ dominance of the game. Jokic is no longer the team’s main point of attack, while the outbreak of Murray this season, the abundant staffing of the bench, makes the Nuggets’ future look bright.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The East is the first in three festivals!

The Lakers&#39; Western rivals are online, and the Lakers have two advantages to crush"><br>The process of the game is like boiling frogs in warm water. In the first quarter, the two sides form a stalemate. At the beginning of the second quarter, the heat once exceeded the score by three points, but from the middle of the game, Nuggets broke out, Millsap forced to eat under the basket, Murray continuously used three points to fuel the fire. At the end of pramley and Grant’s quarter, Nuggets was 10 points ahead of the opponent. Third, save three points of the teacher also, since then, pramley’s sharp deduction, grant and Beasley’s source, the difference has been opened to 20 points, the whole fourth quarter, the heat can’t control the rhythm, 109-89, Nuggets win!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The East is the first in three festivals!

They are going straight to the Lakers. Clippers have decided to manage Leonard’s load. Maybe there is no hard requirement for regular season record. Nuggets are not the same. They are professional. Do they really have no weaknesses?<br>​<br>Yes! In the two games they lost this season, 106-109 to lone ranger and 107-122 to pelican, the same situation happened: the opponent cut off the connection between Murray and his teammates, while keeping Jokic out of the box! In these two games, Murray only scored 30 points and 7 assists, averaging 15 + 3.5 per game, far below his average level. At present, this nuggets, if Jokic is the engine, then Murray is the fuel tank, which can drive teammates’ rhythm and cooperate with teammates. Now Murray can do this! To keep Jokic away from the basket is not only to protect the rebounds, but also to prevent the nuggets from having a second attack.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The East is the first in three festivals!

First of all, Vogel has determined the role of green and Bradley’s defensive defenders. The purpose is very clear. It is aimed at the sharp opponents. Murray is afraid of being trapped and restricted. The Lakers’ interior line and Howard’s defensive ability are beyond doubt. At present, we can see his condition. Except for the first 6 minutes, Howard is playing with Jamie in the rest of the time. The Lakers have achieved good results and won six consecutive games! But Howard and the thick eyebrow joint composition’s no fly area, lets the match unbearable, against the Nuggets, Howard only needs to do well to squeeze out the Jokic!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The East is the first in three festivals!

    <title>The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 7, all nine NBA regular season games ended. Today’s game is too interesting, there are not too many points to watch, and there are not too many strong teams to fight. The expected hard encounter between the clippers and the Bucks, the small card and load management. After a fierce fight, new changes have taken place in the ranking of the East and West. Let’s have a brief look at today’s competition.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom/2684f6dba81044929c4723ef4d1c044b.jpg" alt="The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom"><br>Piston home 122-102 victory over the Knicks, rose continued to lack of play, Griffin close to comeback, while the Knicks side, 1-7, center Mitchell Robinson suspected concussion, Defender Smith is still on leave, only the frontline full of manpower.<br>Pacers beat the Wizards 121-106 at home. The eagles lost 93-113 at home to the bulls. In this game satolanski came back, trejan felt too depressed, only 3 in 12, 0 in 3, 8 in 3, and Collins was banned from the second scoring point of the team, so it was expected that he would lose miserably.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom/1a4a9645ba654ae1b47067cc4ccf1aa3.jpg" alt="The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom"><br>Warriors lost 112-129 to mosaic away, Berks got 28 + 3, rare chance to show, but the overall strength gap is too big.<br>Raptors’ home field thrilling 124-120 win over King, Grizzlies’ home field 137-121 win over Minnesota. Wiggins’s game attitude today, including the performance on the field, has no problem. The whole field scored 30 points and 6 assists. Minnesota lost in the three-point ball, once catching only 2 points, followed by the three-point continuous iron, and was pulled apart.<br>Lone ranger 107-106 narrowly beat magic, jazz 106-104 beat 76 people, and ebbed scored 18 free throws in the whole court. Although the shooting percentage was low and it was hard for gobel to play single, there were many free throws. Simmons left the court in the first quarter ahead of schedule. After the game, it was reported that he had a slight sprain of his left shoulder and acromioclavicular joint. Tomorrow, he will be in Denver for injury assessment.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom/2acf19458b5b47fdb4f470bae26c9d68.jpg" alt="The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom"><br>Clippers lost to bucks 124-129 at home. Luwei 34 points, Harrell 34 points, Beverly 20 points, Bucks can win today’s game is not easy, Hill contribution 24 points, hill and Cornwall a total of 10 three-point shots, letter brother also hit 4, clipper today’s performance proved that even if little card and pickled peppers are not, they are the first-class team in western strength.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom/f5635afea2a84b579160d67d3b5be35e.jpg" alt="The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom"><br>In the eastern ranking, Boston currently ranks first 5-1, Bucks 6-2, heat and 76ers Raptors rank third to fifth, and the teams behind want to catch up with the five teams in front, which is a bit difficult. The nets are only 3-4 at present, and are still outside the playoff threshold. At the bottom is the Knicks, who are believed to be able to hold on until the end of the season.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom/fb2fe09aec6542d89c648c231e115a8a.jpg" alt="The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom"><br>It’s too fierce in the West. The Lakers still rank first after winning 6 games in a row, but the last three have been replaced. Because the Clippers lost, the lone Rangers succeeded in the clippers, and their record came to 5-2, ranking second, but the winning rate is the same as that of nuggets and Suns. All three teams are one game behind the Lakers. The clippers, jazz and mosaics at the back form a third group, which is only half a winning match away from the second gear, and the positions can be exchanged at any time. Up to the eighth spurs and the ninth Timberwolves, they are one victory away from the second lone ranger. It’s hard to open the gap in the whole western region. Due to their poor performance in recent years, the Blazers have also been overtaken by thunder. Maybe the eight places in the Western playoffs will be generated from these 11 teams.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom/2b211abc8b9c490e9b1e6d28227b88ee.jpg" alt="The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom"><br>However, the latter teams are relatively uncompetitive. Pelicans are 1-6, because of Zion’s injury, they came to the bottom of the West early, but their net negative points are not many, but warriors, losing 9.7 points per game. Russell is expected to return in the next game, but green will be short of at least three games. Today’s warriors are fully integrated into the ranks of the bottom in the West. The attack end is not threatening enough, and the defense end is inexperienced. All of them are young players. Even if Russell comes back, it may be difficult to change the status quo.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom/781a91db195c47e99ad681e9b03de607.jpg" alt="The competition in the west is too fierce! Eight teams are only one game apart, and warriors are at the bottom"><br>The following schedule of the Warriors is not optimistic. The Timberwolves thunder is back-to-back. It is closely followed by a series of fights against jazz, Lakers, Celtics, pelicans, grizzly lone ranger, jazz and thunder… I don’t know if Cole can withstand it.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 4, the NBA regular season continued, with the Spurs at home against the Lakers. At present, the Spurs team is 4-1, playing a better performance than expected. Although no one is optimistic about him during the off-season, the Spurs’ tactical play under Popovich’s guidance is still dominated by the team, and the players play their own roles. After Murray’s return, the Spurs’ backcourt pressure is relieved. With the warriors down, the Spurs have a lot of hope to play in the playoffs for 23 years in a row!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time/66f6b69f180f4beeaed280c8a267c51b.jpg" alt="The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time"><br>Today’s Spurs rivals, the Lakers, are in the same hot form and have won four straight games. James and brother bushmei are in excellent competitive condition. Both of them can contribute 56.6 points, 19 rebounds, 13.6 assists, 2.6 steals and 3.4 blocks. All the data almost account for half of the team. Strong eyebrow brother’s super sports ability, is bound to attack and defend both ends to cause great trouble to Adelaide, and James also has an absolute advantage over didozen, the substitute may be the Spurs tonight’s biggest advantage in the match, but also the key to their victory.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time/a2a772cc3c274d38ad8d772f210724d9.jpg" alt="The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time"><br>At the beginning of the game, the Spurs are the first team to win at home. They are very focused on both ends of attack and defense, obviously very full of the game. However, because of his many attacks, the referee’s judgment is controversial, which leads to his attack is very bad (the layup is blocked by James, in fact, it is the interference ball, the layup is hit, the referee is indifferent, 2 + 1 is blown offensive foul). Except James, the Lakers started the game very well. They soon overtook the score, leading by 7 points at one time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time/864eb89445c24acca475c68ebf790bc2.jpg" alt="The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time"><br>But the Lakers then made mistakes, either passing the ball was snatched or directly passing out of the field. The Lakers sent eight mistakes in a single quarter, and the Spurs scored 11 points with these mistakes. Spurs rely on the excellent play of the substitute group, and soon fill the hole dug by the first team. The substitute group scored a total of 14 points in the first quarter, more than the first team, which confirmed that sentence again. In Spurs, only the first team and the second team. And the Lakers substitute only 5 points, Kuzma although in the comeback, but the state of depression, still looking for feelings, the first quarter end of the Lakers to 27-26 lead 1 point.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time/6475c95c343546fdb6390312e2cfef59.jpg" alt="The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time"><br>In the second quarter of the game, the score was still tight. When the Spurs came back from the first round, the situation turned sharply. The five players in the first round lost their accuracy. In the first 21 shots, there were only 5, and the three-point shooting rate of the whole team was only 20%. While the Lakers’ three-point shooting rate is as high as 38%. At the same time, James also strengthened the impact on the Spurs’ restricted area and improved his scoring efficiency, which is the important reason why the Lakers can still lead with 10 Mistakes in half-time. At the end of the first half, the Lakers led by 13 points, 56-43, with Kuzma’s midfield outposting 3 points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time/9e4b74efaaf5468bb2a57b94132ea370.jpg" alt="The Spurs are in the doldrums, starting to dig holes for the reserves, and the Lakers are still 13 points ahead of 10 Mistakes in half-time"><br>Look at the data of the first half of the next two teams, the Spurs: adelain 6 points 3 rebounds, drozan 5 points 3 rebounds, plus or minus - 22 the lowest in the whole field, Murray 2 points 4 rebounds 3 assists, guy 8 points 4 rebounds 3 assists, white 6 points 2 rebounds, mills 4 points. Lakers: James 11 points, 8 rebounds, 8 assists, plus or minus value + 18, the highest in the whole game, brother bushmei 15 points, 5 rebounds, Bradley 10 points, 2 rebounds, pop 7 points, Howard 4 points, 7 rebounds, Kuzma 3 points. Looking forward to the adjustment of spurs in the second half, the game is more exciting!</p>

Yingge, who was known as Durant’s successor at the beginning of the game, was short of the chance to prove himself in the Lakers. After arriving at Pelican, he picked up the team to move forward when Zion was injured. Last Pelican lost to thunder, Ingram was injured in the head and left the court. The examination results showed that there would be no concussion. Yingge, who continues to start today, started his duel with Owen.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/92343ae09b1d4f378402e174f3ab6baf.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>In fact, Ingram was the top player in 2016. In the three years of playing for the Lakers, Ingram was far below the expectation of fans. In the thick brow trade, the Lakers didn’t want to send ZMA out of the library and put him in the trade. Previously, it was diagnosed that there was a deep vein thrombosis in the right shoulder. Originally, the pelican didn’t hold much hope for him, and didn’t renew his contract in advance before the start of the season, just The last year of Ingram’s contract, but Ingram in the first seven games but let everyone shine!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/4fa833cf8a1b4b8ab1ba5fc99970a521.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>In the first game, Ingram easily got 22 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists. In the third game, Ingram contributed 25 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists. In the third game, Yingge sent 35 + 15 points, 27 + 10 points in the fourth game, 25 + 3 points in the fifth game. Yingge was injured and left in 13 minutes. In today’s game, he cut 40 + 5 + 5 points and 174 points in the sixth game, averaging 29 points, with a hit rate of 51.1%. Now, it’s true We can put Ingram in the position of Durant’s successor!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/1e6ec64251334dd5a3cbf6dca95891dd.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>Today, we can see the significance of Yingge to pelicans from the first game with the nets. In the first quarter, Yingge scored 9 points in 4 of Yingge 4. When her teammates didn’t feel the same, Yingge resisted the heavy burden alone. In the third quarter, when the nets once pulled the difference to 20 points, Ingram stood up, three-point ball, jump shot, break through the emergency stop and hit the board. In the single quarter, Yingge scored 10 points and 3 assists. Pelican also played in the single quarter With a high score of 48 points, the nets, including Owen today, scored double for six people. Owen was in excellent condition, but still couldn’t defeat the pelican completely. Ingram played a crucial role.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/b20171b9213f4715b8bfc6f0c4d48972.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>For the Lakers, they have given away the ball brother, Yingge and Hart, but they have got brother bushmei. At this stage, the Lakers won 5 consecutive victories and won the first place in the West. Their goal this season is to rush to the championship. At least at this stage, they will not regret it, because they need stars of this level.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers/d17ebeb1d95a44d3abece7c1826416cc.jpg" alt="The pelican picked up a Durant! 174 points in 6 games, 170 million sprint after leaving the Lakers"><br>But for pelicans, it’s really a happy worry. In fact, they have the chance to reach an early renewal with Yingge before the start of the season. Although Simmons, sICAM, Murray and others have all got the top salary contract, if they negotiate with Yingge before the season, they really have the chance to complete the renewal in a non top salary way. But if Yingge continues to go crazy, it’s more than 20 points per game until Ming Dynasty In the summer of, the pelican offered another contract of about $100 million. Yingge would refuse. Would the pelican offer Yingge a contract of $170 million for five years?</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 4, today’s NBA regular season is over. There are six games, except the first one between the Pacers and the bulls. Listen to me. First of all, we can be sure that with the deepening of the season, there may be a 12-to-8 situation in the West. The momentum of thunder and king is gradually picking up. Of course, the initiative is in their own hands, and it’s very easy to put it in bad condition. But there is only one team in the West that is currently the least competitive.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/8f24268bc26c4f658595e2257c3c24d1.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>Let’s take a look at today’s competition. The Pacers beat the bulls 108-95 at home, winning three in a row after losing three in a row, and they are back in the top eight in the East. The match between King and Knicks is more exciting. Morris and Barrett are really fierce in Knicks, but Randall’s sense of existence is too low after losing the ball right. Frankly, he can’t do dirty work. Potis is even worse. He was pushed to No. 5 position to face berecha. In the third quarter, he hurt people maliciously. At last, King defeated Knicks 113-92 away from home. King won the second game of the season and successfully surpassed warriors. Nix, the last one in the East.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom/520db34b93b14b0a8bdc5c38c1eb0491.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>The heat beat a red team 129-100 at home. From the first quarter, the heat exploded. Leonard’s mid shot, Nathan’s and Butler’s three-point ball, Adebayor’s under basket hard play, the heat’s 46-14 score in a single quarter set three team history records, and the red team was also nailed to the stigma column in the first game. In the second quarter, the heat’s offensive momentum slowed down, but the red team also couldn’t score. They like to throw three points, but they just can’t make it. They simply break in Foul under the basket. And in the fourth quarter, the difference was pulled back to 40 points, which was terrible! Tell Paul I’m sorry. You’re the wrong one. Nobody can take them with you. By the way, the fat man should finish class quickly. Don’t lose face.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>The Lakers beat the Spurs 103-96 on the road, which was also interesting. The Lakers once drew a 13 point gap. In the third quarter, the Spurs were wiped out successfully. In the fourth quarter, the Warcraft came out. The low post singles and violence filled the box. Popovich was so angry that he directly replaced bolt for introspection. In the last quarter of Warcraft, he scored 10 points, 6 rebounds and 2 blocks, dreaming back to the top! Although the old Zhan feel depressed, also has three pairs to enter the account, two consecutive three pairs, NBA history’s second oldest three pairs of players, Lakers five consecutive wins!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>Solo Xiake field 131-111 sweep the Knights. In the first quarter, Lefu was able to fight with dongqiqi, but from the second quarter, the Cavaliers couldn’t hold up. Dongqiqi was placed in the position of small forward, like laozhan, who could control the rhythm, break through, pass, wave God in the Cavaliers’ inner line, all kinds of big hats, dongqiqi cut 29 + 15 + 14, dongqiqi beat laozhan across the air: you have two games and three pairs in a row, so can I! You look like 35 years old me, I look like 20 years old you<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>Clippers beat jazz 105-94 at home. Jazz is the most aggrieved, leading 3 quarters, Mitchell broke out at the end of the 17 points alone, or lost! It was lost to Leonard, two records, three points and one back. All of a sudden, it raised the whole clipper’s morale. Then look at Harrell, the violence frame; look at Luwei, the unreasonable three points also came. The heart of killing and killing broke out in the fourth quarter. Mitchell cut 36 points in the air. It’s not like Leonard’s data. What happened in 4 of 15 in the first three quarters? The whole show can still get 30 points, superstar The ruling power of!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>In the Western Conference Ranking, the Lakers ranked first with 5-1 loss, losing 100 points per game, ranking second in the Western Conference and third in the league. The Timberwolves are close behind, the Clippers are third with 5-2, while the West has four teams with the same record: Lone Ranger, Nuggets, Suns and spurs. It’s too hard! At present, among the last few in the west, Pelican received good news today. Ingram is not in great trouble. He may play in the net next time. The king is far away. Only a grizzly bear is left with the warrior!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers keep the first, four teams in the same record, the warriors lose competitiveness at the bottom"><br>Warriors today and harvest bad news, Russell may be due to ankle injury, continue to miss tomorrow’s home game against the Blazers! The warriors are likely to continue to put in that starting lineup of just seven million people: Stan, Robinson, Bowman, Jordan Poole, Pascal! Look at all sad ah! Against the old rivals, none of the big four can go up. The question is, can Lillard do it in the second quarter?</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 10, there are not many regular NBA games today, only five games, but the quality of the Games is very high. After five games, the situation in the West has become more and more chaotic. Compared with last season, the general direction has been determined. The Lakers have replaced the warriors and the Warriors have replaced the suns.<br>Talk about five games.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/1605524ebe0849c9a3e166c8b9e60004.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Celtic sweep the Spurs 135-115 away. In the game, another scene that people don’t want to see happened again. In the confrontation with Adelaide, Hayward broke his left hand, his arm was obviously stressed, and he put it on Adelaide’s right hand, which was just back to the peak, and the biggest setback in his life! Hope Hayward can recover soon! Of course, in today’s game, Celtic’s back court double shot performance was brilliant. Brown scored 30 points and 7 rebounds, and Walker also scored 26 points and 8 assists. After this game, Celtic ranked first in the East, 7-1 record!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/6abd3756022c45aa8dd7487b27f8358b.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>The Hornets lost 110-115 at home to the pelican, Ingram scored 25 points, Redick scored 5-3 points and 20 points. With the victory of this game, the pelican officially got rid of the title of Western crane tail and kicked the warriors down.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/4d958826bafd448ba814340ebfd2108f.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>The Bulls lost to mosaics 94-117 at home. In the first half, the bulls were only 1 point behind. As a result, the third quarter was spent directly. Mustache and youth scored 22 points in a single quarter. They beat the bulls in a wave. Mustache scored 42 points in this game, and the youth also scored 26 points. What’s interesting is that the garbage time of the game is so long. The yellow hair center has played for 42 minutes. Yes, no one is available on the bench.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic!

The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>In the fourth quarter, the edge players of lone ranger got more chances to play. After this war, lone ranger won 6 and lost 3, tied for the third place in the West.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic!

The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Thunder beat warriors 114-108 at home. Warriors really did not put bad, Russell led the team in the third quarter to wipe out 17 points difference, the single quarter team got 41 points, the fourth quarter, said the collapse! Played until the end did not give up, but the difference is too big, lost! After this game, warriors are 2-8, with the west at the bottom. Remember the opponents warriors beat before: blazers, pelicans. In the next week, warriors will face jazz, Lakers and Celtic… Is this the bottom position in the west?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/6c163ddfb6284e53b887116b9ec54233.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Take a look at the eastern rankings. After Celtic’s seven wins in a row, they are ranked first in the East. Raptors are also very strong, ranking second in the East. Behind them, heat, bucks and 76 are ranked 3-5. Knicks 2-7, better than warriors.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/ee9c729588c742e9821013087fc51b99.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Western rankings are much more complicated. The Lakers also won seven games in a row, ranking first in the West. Nuggets are still as close to the Lakers as they were to warriors last season. I’m afraid that the identity of the second millennium player will not change for a while. In the third place, the four teams are tied! Mosaic, clipper, jazz, lone ranger! It’s basically the return of the gods. The Suns behind can not be ignored, after all, their position is occupied by warriors, only showdown, can only sprint to the playoffs!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun/7bde28961a5c4417916d3e3e6e6efd49.jpg" alt="The situation in the west is chaotic! The Lakers replace the warriors, the fourth team grabs the third, the warriors take the sun"><br>Trailblazer 3 win 6 lose, and warriors form a pair of brothers and sisters, Lillard alone a little difficult. Pelican and grizzly bear will not say, the strength is like this, but warriors really did not put bad, every game players fighting spirit, attitude, hard work impeccable, today played to the last second did not give up, did not put bad, strength is so. Alas, the five-year system dominates the west, only one summer, and now it has become a stepping stone for other teams!</p>

The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>On November 6, there are 6 NBA regular season contests in total today, all of which are followed. It’s a bit messy, and the end time is too concentrated, which makes it hard for editors to write! After six games, the Lakers are at the top of the Western Conference with six wins in a row. Next, the schedule of the Lakers is relatively easy. Now let’s see who can pull the Lakers down.<br>Let’s talk about today’s game!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/fc757bc2cf4f4a50aab0bb4f01095d77.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>Hornets beat Pacers 122-120 at home. The two winning teams are in good condition. The walkers once led the opponents by 19 points, but they were even in the regular period. Thank the referee! In overtime, the Hornets are relying on free throws to win the opponent! The comparison of free throws in the whole game, Hornets 42 times, walkers 7 times. The disparity is too great! After this battle, the hornet with a wave of three consecutive wins, into the eastern top eight!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>Celtic 119-113 defeat knight. Hayward burst out, scoring 39 points, 7 rebounds and 8 assists, 16 of 16 two-point shots, playing in the third quarter, unbelieving evil, three-point shots have to be cast several times, three iron, or two points better! The Cavaliers didn’t give up the game, the fourth quarter also played a wave of 13-2 climax, but Hayward’s last-minute make-up shot completely killed the suspense of the game, Hayward set a new scoring record in Boston. Celtic are currently 5-1, second in the East!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>The Hawks beat the Spurs 108-100 at home. As a Spurs fan, it may be very desperate, if there are any Spurs fans. In the first half, Trey young scored 0 in 8, and got 1 point by free throw. In the second half, Trey young combined with Xu Erte to bomb the Spurs from all angles and three-dimensional, all kinds of three-point goals! In the fourth quarter, the Hawks scored 38 points. The Spurs couldn’t get any points. They were desperate! In the second half, Trey young scored 28 points, 13 assists and 2 steals. Who can control him?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/26cc2f5aba374ab78b99fb0cf9a1a1bc.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>The Lakers beat the bulls 118-112, fell 19 points at one time. The trip home of bushmei was so depressed that they all shook their heads. Howard only got three fouls in the first nine minutes. He didn’t finish the first half. The Lakers made 11 mistakes! Can we win? Cook’s three points, Howard’s slam dunk, Kuzma’s consecutive layup, the Bulls players were confused: our coach only taught us how to defend old Zhan and bushmei, but not how to play the Lakers’ backup! In fact, the Lakers need more people to come forward and share the pressure of Jamie. It’s impossible that they are always accurate and in good condition! And this wave of six consecutive victories, including green, Howard, cook and Kuzma, all contribute their strength to both ends of the attack and defense, which is enough!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/490f8fc931df490ca7b21489363537ab.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>In the other two games, thunder defeated magic 102-94 at home, Paul sent 20 + 6 data, Nuggets 109-89 swept the first heat in the East, spending three quarters.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess!

The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>In terms of ranking, at present, the number one player in the East is 76, Celtic are tied, both 5-1, the heat momentum is good, but today’s game is really not suitable for Denver’s Highland home court. The Bucks followed, with raptors, wasps, eagles and walkers in the top eight. Nix is free and easy.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/d76faf4129ff48f197dd59802c1aeaa5.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>On the western side, the Lakers have a strong position of No. 1 in the West with a six game winning streak. But behind the Lakers, Nuggets, Suns and Clippers are all 5-2, holding a tight position against the Lakers. Suns are the most amazing. They beat kings, nuggets and jazz with one point. They beat clippers and warriors in a row. It’s not polite to say that this team full of abandoned players in the league is now reborn. Baines can cast three points and open space. Rubio organizes. Booke scores with all his strength. Ubere kills on the flank. Although it’s not the top in the west, it’s not the best team in the world It’s tough!<br>The Spurs have lost 1-3 in the last four games, losing to the clippers and the Lakers, and to the eagles, and have fallen out of the top eight.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/b8f8f92ac6674eb3bdf30cd8533d8c09.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>The other black horse in the West belongs to the lone ranger, or the lone ranger has the strength to attack the top six or even the top four in the West. Their schedule has been the most difficult since the start of the lone ranger game, including a series of games against the Blazers, Nuggets, Lakers, etc., but they are very stable, and they can win the ball and never lose. Dongqiqi has two consecutive matches and three doubles, with 15 assists in a row. After Kyd, the first solo player, Posen has gradually adapted to the system of solo player. He and Powell partner complement each other in the inner line. The best embodiment of the game is to beat nuggets. When dongqiqi is in a downturn, more people stand out in the ball team, but when dongqiqi breaks out, it is almost unstoppable. Unless it’s the Lakers, go for each other!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated/c86cd911d4ea4732848ead42ea6a271a.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers were surrounded by three teams, the Spurs fell out of the top eight, two black horses have accumulated"><br>At present, in the west, Grizzlies and pelicans are in a worrying state. Grizzlies are rebuilding. Pelicans are injured by Zion. Although Yingge can score 29 points per game, pelicans are still hard to compete. Wait for Zion to return and see if the top talent can be realized. In just half a year, I have experienced two injuries!</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner/18157b3e7ec945aba8a5c68eebc9d9a9.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner"><br>On November 9, there are 11 games in the NBA today. Many stars join in the free cutting group today, such as Lillard’s 60 points, such as dongqiqi’s 38 + triple doubles, such as Russell’s 52 points. After 11 games, the ranking of the West has become more and more chaotic. The Lakers have gone, and the rest of the team is in a mess.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner/a509df9103204eccaefa9ff385f88290.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner"><br>Let’s talk about today’s game. Pelican lost 104-122 at home to raptors, cicham scored 44 points and rolled Ingram. Yingge scored 27 points, but its efficiency was relatively low. Is Pelican going to book the position at the end of the Western Conference in advance? King beat hawks 121-109 away, won three of the four games, waved goodbye to warriors and headed for thunder. The Timberwolves beat warriors 125-119 extra time at home, Russell scored 52 points, and finished 14 points at the end of the fourth quarter alone, which was useless. Wiggins responded 40 points. Besides, Downes, although other Timberwolves players felt bad, they were better than warriors, and Timberwolves succeeded in stopping the losing streak.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner/f2aa8e675cb3421c9c3a23d3c020a641.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner"><br>The lone ranger lost 4 points at home to the Knicks. The game between nuggets and the 76ers lasted until the last 1 second. The 76ers were repeatedly fouled and lost 3 points away to nuggets. In the face of the Bucks challenge, the Jazz once led the opponent by 22 points and made 3 mistakes in the last 3 minutes. Fortunately, Bogdanovic also won the Bucks three points! The game between the Blazers and the nets can be called a fairy fight. The Blazers only rely on one Lillard, give the ball to Lillard, and then watch him score! Air cut 60 points, can’t bear to have opposite Ding Weidi and Owen double force, the pioneer lost again!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner/afa17043b7754a8f89cc4a9ee4eb4a67.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner"><br>The Lakers and heat game is a defensive battle. In this game, only old Zhan, bushmei, Butler and Dragic can score. Old Zhan feels hot. He embroiders three times. In the singles, Butler turns the top. Butler will be shut down by old Zhan Xiu! Zhan scored 25 + 6 points and bushmei scored 27 points. The Lakers won 95-80 at home, seven in a row! In other games, Cavaliers beat wizards away, magic beat Grizzlies at home, walkers narrowly beat pistons at home.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner/6dcc583b72c94eebb2e88ddde15565e7.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner"><br>The ranking of the west is a mess! After the Lakers won 7 consecutive games, they took the first place in the West. Denver Nuggets have been fighting hard recently. They all won in the end. Hold on to the Lakers closely. Jazz and Clippers are linked together. After the Clippers are fined by the league, Leonard’s rotation may be reduced in the future. Pickled peppers will come back next week. Clippers are the biggest threat to the Lakers<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner/bdb3162f9a3949f4ba83379c32442d5b.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner"><br>In addition to the fourth place, mosaic, Suns, spurs, lone Rangers and Timberwolves are all 5-3, basically in line with the strength level of each team. In fact, including clippers and jazz, the gap between these seven teams is not big, and the overall competitiveness of the western region is very strong! Sun all the way up, lost three games is quite unexpected, 1 point lost nuggets, 1 point lost jazz, lost heat. The Spurs have a little ups and downs, but it can be called a strong and weak discriminator. They lost several games against the Lakers clippers. They can easily win in the face of warriors and thunder. Under the leadership of dongqiqi and Boshen, the lone ranger gradually stabilized the pace, but today’s loss was absolutely unexpected. The five death of the Knicks finally came to use, frantically fighting for the front rebounds! The Timberwolves are the most surprising team. Wiggins scored 40 points today to lead the team to respond to the warriors. Wiggins is getting better and better. He has broken the thermos cup, no longer blindly shooting outside. His talent has been fulfilled!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner/9825b400aa4842a48eec1916ffc01d87.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! The Lakers won the game, the five teams gathered together, and the warriors ushered in a new partner"><br>At the bottom of the list, except for the pelican, who is the last but not the least, warriors welcome new partners and pioneers. Blazers spent 296 million dollars this summer to keep lilad and mclem, the two core players of the team, together with the introduction of dabaibian and hezonia, the strength is not bad, but it seems to be unable to knead in place. Nurkiki’s injury and the departure of hackers still have some impact, coupled with the team’s frequent injuries, losing 6 in 9 games, just like close to the warriors, who can think this is last season What about the two teams that will play in the Western Conference?</p>

For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>On November 2, today’s NBA games are all over. There are 8 matches, many of which are out of favor. There are also games that won’t be decided until extra time. Let’s summarize briefly. The ranking of the west is a bit disorderly now. It can’t afford to lose. The top ten in the west can’t afford to lose. The Jazz lost one game and fell to the fourth. The lone ranger won the Lakers today, which is the first, the eighth, and the heart!<br>The Bucks won the magic 123-91 away from home. At the beginning of the game, the magic gave the bucks a low horse power, 20-9 ahead of the Bucks, and then the magic was stunned. The Bucks responded to a wave of 40-9 in more than one game. The magic couldn’t hold up and lost miserably! There is little suspense in the dialogue between the strong and the weak in the East, 91-123.<br>The Pacers are gaining momentum. They beat Cavaliers 102-95 at home. Pacers have won two consecutive victories, ranking seventh in the East with a record of 2-3 loss<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams/fa62ba58e5b14402838f15103fa54b23.jpg" alt="The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>Nets home 123-116 to a red team in the west, Owen slowly adapt to the team’s rhythm, this field sent 10 assists, in Owen’s series, Prince, Harris, Leverett three people cut 67 points, Owen 22 + 10 account. The west red team, two MVP level guard three-point goal add up 22 middle 3, the last minute is only behind 5 points, then throws three points crazily, 4 even iron, the game has not.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in chaos again!

For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>Celtic 104-102 Knicks, not Celtic playing badly, but Knicks playing too well. Morris was merciless in the face of the old lord. At the last moment, he was strong three points, cutting 29 + 9 by himself, but Tatum also had a big heart. At the last second, he stepped on the line for two minutes, killing!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in chaos again!

For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>The lone ranger lost to the Lakers 110-119 at home. Dongqiqi was really fierce. He easily cut three pairs in three quarters, with 31 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds. But the Lakers still caught up with the difference in the fourth quarter based on the performance of James and bushmei. Green’s three points were absolutely flat. In extra time, Zhan’s time, a wave of 7-0 plus the unreasonable three-point emergency stop, killed the game. Zhan alone cut 39 + 16+ 12, 35 years old, can still call 43 minutes, say out who letter ah, change the age?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams/f8a722a7db564104a62d5cbd657daeb2.jpg" alt="The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>Piston 106-112 lost to the bulls, Rose’s journey home, cut 23 points and 7 assists, what is the situation of 20000 fans of the Chicago United Center Stadium shouting MVP? Rose didn’t fail to live up to the expectations of the fans. Two times, he was able to fly, rose or rose. Can rose return to Chicago to finish his career?<br>King’s home 102-101 narrowly beat jazz, and finally won the first victory of the new season, or from the first in the West. There is no problem with the overall performance of jazz. Today fox played well, cutting 25 + 5 + 4, Walton can sit in the coach seat for a while.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams/58faecade35f4e08887e7fe48b21da99.jpg" alt="The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>Warriors lost 110-127 at home to Spurs. Two consecutive defeats, opening five games, 1 win and 4 losses, losing 126.4 points per game, the defensive League last. Spurs also rotation off a Murray, drozan also did not play long, love ah! Green went out for 34 minutes, 2 out of 7, got 6 points, 7 assists and 8 rebounds. Before the game, green vowed to say that Curie was not in. He wanted to shoulder the team, play more aggressively, and shoulder the responsibility of the boss. And then that’s the data! Sorry, I can’t find any reason to praise you. You are not worth four years and 100 million.<br>Green, please start your performance as soon as possible. The warriors have reached this point. Don’t you play yet?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams/19af7aae52d3406ba2a143e1b3e50288.jpg" alt="The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>In terms of ranking, with a wave of 4 consecutive wins, the Lakers won the first place in the western region. What’s more, the Lakers’ defense ranked second in the western region, the net efficiency of the Lakers ranked first in the western region and the league! The Lakers have gradually become a team with more balanced overall strength. In the future, the schedule of the Lakers is relatively easy. See how long the Lakers can sit in the first position in the West.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams/5d8b8af0d7fe4793a0286f115ee89e7c.jpg" alt="The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>Spurs second, Timberwolves play one less game, ranking third, the top ten in the west, with an overall winning rate of more than 60%, which is exaggerated. Of course, many teams have only played four or five games, with little reference significance, but we can see the overall competitiveness of the west, and there is a gap between the 10th and 11th. The next five teams, I’m afraid, will also be very much in the future It’s hard to catch up with the top ten. The warriors are 1-4 perfect in this section. The king at the bottom also wins. The pelicans are gradually running in and forming. The warriors have room to fall! Maybe last season’s warriors are still in the finals. In the new season, it’s more practical to target the lottery. But to be honest, who can the warriors beat now?<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams/a6ba69590c8d43f89d3e184c2f903a2d.jpg" alt="The west is in chaos again! For the first time, the Lakers won the first place, the Clippers ranked fifth, and the warriors ranked bottom with the three teams"><br>Check the warriors’ future schedule. Tomorrow’s back-to-back game against the Hornets is very difficult. Then there will be a series of devil’s schedules: the Blazers, the west red team, the Timberwolves thunder back to back, the jazz, the Lakers, the Celtics, November 18. We should be able to play against the pelicans, but we should.</p>

    <title>The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game. Pierce was right. It&#39;s time for green to compromise</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Golden State Warriors lost again today. They lost 87-93 to the Hornets and suffered three consecutive defeats. The season started 1-5, the worst start for Steve Cole since he took over. It has to be said that warriors are too miserable now. Last year, they were five-star. One summer, the five stars of warriors all became the audience. The Datong center is really poisonous. Fengshui is certainly not as good as Oracle. Thompson’s injury is basically reimbursed for one season, and Durant’s is reimbursed for one season in the nets. Curie’s wrist was broken for three months, Green’s fingers were hurt, and Russell was exempt.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game.

It&#39;s time for green to compromise"><br>Everyone thinks warriors can’t win the championship, so it’s OK to enter the playoffs. But the reality is so cruel, Russell has become the only minor injury player in the four-star warriors. He originally came to the warriors as the senior four, and now he is regarded as the boss again. Russell also stopped working.<br>In addition, today’s warriors start five tigers with a total salary of only $7 million. Among them, Bowman’s salary is $80000, pool1.96 million, Robinson III’s $1.88 million, Pascal’s $900000, and colistan’s $2.18 million. One of the luckiest must be colistan. He was afraid of not playing time when he joined. Now he is going to play until he vomits.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game.

It&#39;s time for green to compromise"><br>For today’s game losing coach Cole after the game is also a public apology, and take responsibility. Cole thinks the players are doing their best today. They fought hard, and the coach must have lost in the end. The coach screwed up. So instead of refusing to carry the pot, Cole offered to apologize. In fact, Cole doesn’t have no idea. How about winning? Warriors still can’t make it to the playoffs. It doesn’t make sense to fight in the absence of so many core players. It’s better to choose to put rotten. Warriors now have excuses to put rotten. After all, people’s lineup is really rotten. Unlike Xiao Hua’s resistance to putting rotten lineups, warriors are not rotten.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game. Pierce was right. It's time for green to compromise/f618e5ae62224dc0b8c3a7451fa79179.jpg" alt="The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game. Pierce was right. It&#39;s time for green to compromise"><br>Today, Paul Pierce, a former NBA player and now ESPN commentator, sent a good news to the warriors. Pierce thinks that with so many wounded warriors, it may be a blessing in disguise. Because it can make the warrior feel relieved to put on the rotten, and do not need to bear the curse. This is a very good opportunity. Of course, warriors don’t need to be rotten. They will lose even if they work hard.<br>Pearce said: “with   clay Thompson absent from this season, Curie’s wrist will be reimbursed for three months. I don’t think it’s bad news for warriors, it’s good news. It’s a blessing in disguise, though you never want to see anyone hurt. But warriors do have a chance to get a lottery ticket, maybe they can finish the reconstruction plan ahead of time.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game. Pierce was right. It's time for green to compromise/538fcfc576cb414eb56a55f32bb67bb8.jpg" alt="The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game. Pierce was right. It&#39;s time for green to compromise"><br>Pierce is right. It’s an opportunity for the warriors, and dramonde green needs to compromise. Before Greene refused to put on the bad, he said the warriors can still enter the playoffs, even if curry is absent for three months. But as long as he does not fall, the warrior will continue to fight. Now it’s providence that makes green fall. That’s how it happens.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game. Pierce was right. It's time for green to compromise/9005fcd97e674ecfba1b70b9ea66c526.jpg" alt="The worst start in five years! Cole apologized after the game. Pierce was right. It&#39;s time for green to compromise"><br>Green just said that unless he is injured, he will continue to fight for the playoffs. He is injured immediately. There is a destiny in the dark, so the warriors should put it in a bad place. This season, it’s time to let go.</p>

    <title>What a pity! What&#39;s the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points</title>
    <url>/2020/11/10/What%20a%20pity!%20What&#39;s%20the%20level%20of%20the%20team%20that%20can%20make%20the%20last%20one%20in%20the%20West%20beat%2021%20points/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of November 4, the NBA regular season ended. The Knicks met the king at home. This was the first direct dialogue between the East and the west at the end of the league table since the 13th day of NBA. Knicks, 1-5, averaged 7.2 points; king, 1-5, averaged 14 points. From the data, it seems that the Knicks are better. After all, they hoard so many players in the position of power forward, but only after a fight between the two sides found that it was not so. The Knicks could not withstand the impact of the king at all. 92-113, the Knicks lost 21 points at home!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/What a pity! What's the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points/fb8a8ba45c56475d9d4be7c3052688d4.jpg" alt="What a pity! What&#39;s the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points"><br>In terms of data, on the king’s side, Barnes has 19 points and 4 rebounds, Holmes has 14 points and 10 rebounds, berecha has 10 points and 8 rebounds and 6 assists, fox has 24 points and 6 assists, and Hilde has 22 points and 4 rebounds. On the Knicks side, little Morris has 28 points and 6 rebounds, Randall has 8 points and 7 rebounds, Portis has 2 points and 6 rebounds, Barrett has 22 points and 5 rebounds, and nilikina has 2 points. Only from the player list, the starting point of Knicks is the configuration of two defenders and three power forwards. You let Portis play position five. He really can’t move belica and let Morris play small forward. He can’t keep up with Barnes and Hilde’s speed at all. It’s embarrassing.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/What a pity! What's the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points/45ae463bc1a04ab489c064b47e323bc1.jpg" alt="What a pity! What&#39;s the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points"><br>In the first quarter, the king took the lead in opening the handle, hildren scored 8 points, Holmes followed up to make up the basket and directly stopped the Knicks. Pause to come back, berecha continues to shoot in the middle, fox retreats to jump shot, the king slowly pulls the difference to double figures, the single section King leads by 9 points. In the second quarter, the king, led by Barnes and dedmond, reached another 8-0 climax. Bergdan’s three points made the difference between the two sides 20 points. Only Morris and Barrett were left on the Knicks’ side. At the end of half-time, the king 61-41 Knicks.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/What a pity! What's the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points/1e6995b02368493693652855fd5759ac.jpg" alt="What a pity! What&#39;s the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points"><br>In the third quarter, the king’s bombardment continued. Fox, Barnes and Hilde hit three points in a row. The Knicks were more and more anxious to play. Bottis also had a malicious injury action against Barnes, and was judged as level 1 malicious. The difference was already 30 points. The game lost all suspense. At last, the king won 21 points away from Knicks and ushered in two consecutive wins!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/What a pity! What's the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points/5a28485881b64988b68470624c4510d9.jpg" alt="What a pity! What&#39;s the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points"><br>Why is Nix so miserable? In fact, the strength of Nix’s defense on the outside line from the beginning was not enough. After the king’s outside line feeling blossomed, Nix couldn’t defend it, because the king also had Fox and Hilde, two breakthrough top soldiers. Randall had misplaced sheets for several times, and Portis couldn’t withstand berecha and dedmond under the basket. Even though Morris and Barrett had a good feeling, they failed miserably. Today they let the country Wang scored 14 three-point goals in the third quarter, too passive!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/What a pity! What's the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points/8c760d0509604ff98d698e07e9705525.jpg" alt="What a pity! What&#39;s the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points"><br>King in winning this game, 2-5 record, has successfully surpassed the warriors, so that, at present, the Western penultimate position only pelicans and warriors in the competition, but pelicans also have good, Ingram’s last injury back no matter, if pelicans win again, then no team can compete with warriors.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/What a pity! What's the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points/936a556867db4eed839732284ca10ab9.jpg" alt="What a pity! What&#39;s the level of the team that can make the last one in the West beat 21 points"><br>On the Knicks side, the record is 1-6. Before the season, Portis said that his team’s goal is to enter the playoffs. Although Barrett also said that he would lead the Knicks to rise, but to be honest, for this Knicks, the most realistic goal is to put rotten. Keep winning the lottery. There is little pressure in the eastern competition, but be careful about warriors in the future, Bi There is the level of development alliance.</p>

    <title>What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place</title>
    <url>/2020/11/06/What%20does%20it%20feel%20like%20to%20be%20hit%20by%20James%20Caruso%20almost%20made%20the%20injury%20list,%20and%20cook%20rolled%20in%20place/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Lakers beat the bulls 118-112 away for six straight wins. After losing to the Clippers in the first game, the Lakers seemed to get through the second vein of Ren Du, and they improved greatly in both attack and defense. And six wins in a row is the Lakers’ first since the 10-11 season. The Lakers have won six straight regular season wins in the 10-11 season. The final record was 57-25. The Lakers also won nine in a row, eight in a row, and seven in a row that season. It has to be said that the Lakers have made great progress this season compared with last season, and the ranking continues to be the first in the west, 6-1.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place/7c4e3c610c0f4493bcb68375b4e4470f.jpg" alt="What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place"><br>LeBron James is in good shape today, and he is struggling to support Davis when he doesn’t feel good. 11 of 19 shots, 30 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists, 2 steals and 1 cover. Of course, the Lakers also want to thank their strong bench. At the beginning of the game, Lakers fans envied the Clippers’ bench, because Luwei and Harrell repeatedly dug holes in the main force.<br>But now Lakers fans don’t have to envy them. They have their own bench gangsters. Kuzma’s return increased the firepower of the second team. In the last quarter, Kuzma, Howard, Caruso and cook hit a 16-0 attack wave in the absence of Jamie to fill in 13 points and return to three points.<br>In the game, James played 35 minutes, got 30 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists, 2 steals and 1 cover in 11 of 19 shots; kaluso played 24 minutes, 2 of 8 shots, 7 points, 3 rebounds, 1 assists and 2 steals.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place/bfe3426f42ab49308f9b6e832cec968d.jpg" alt="What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place"><br>James is also excited to celebrate with Caruso in the game. James is really powerful. Caruso was almost injured in the collision with James. After today’s game, Caruso was still full of fear when he talked about James. Because today, when he collided with James, he chose to lean a little bit instead of facing all the frontal impacts.<br>“LeBron was so passionate, I was so excited, he was so excited, we couldn’t help but do it,” Caruso said. But LeBron clearly didn’t realize how powerful he was. Brother, you should be careful. Because of the impact you’ve brought to me, I’ve estimated 80 pounds. Fortunately, I dodged for a while, otherwise I would be on the injury list. Of course, I’m ok now, ha ha<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place/a87b7b7e9e6d43c9a8e2c009c49dafbd.jpg" alt="What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place"><br>Today, kaluso played 24 minutes, 7 points, 3 rebounds, 1 assists, 2 steals. It’s very good at the defensive end, but also completed a snatch, and scored 2 + 1 in the fast break. It can only be said that James is really strong. He weighs 113 kg and 250 lbs. When James sprinted at full speed, Yao said it was like a pickup truck.<br>Although James and Caruso only slightly hit the chest, but no doubt the impact is not small. Do you remember a leg in the second half today? Cook wants to rebound with James under the basket.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place/60b95b66a11c484bbd5576ca652fed46.jpg" alt="What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place"><br>What happened as a result? Cook and James were directly knocked over after the confrontation, and turned over for a while. At last, James looked at cook worried, and found that he left safely when he was free, while Howard pulled cook up.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/06/What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place/d72dcb2770c74bdeaa3f39f1f6336c66.jpg" alt="What does it feel like to be hit by James Caruso almost made the injury list, and cook rolled in place"><br>There’s no doubt that it’s a monster that James can be so healthy with such a weight. Many people say Zion is the next James, but Zion’s body is not as good as James.</p>

    <title>Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn&#39;t agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team</title>
    <url>/2020/11/10/Want%20to%20put%20on%20a%20bad%20show,%20but%20Paul%20doesn&#39;t%20agree!%20Thunder%20won%20the%20third,%20Paul%20led%20the%20team%20to%20catch%20up%20with%20the%20old%20team/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 6, a regular season NBA game ended at noon. Thunder played magic at home. Magic is familiar with opening high and leaving low. The final result of the game was 102-94. Thunder won the third victory of the season! In the final stage of the game, thunder successfully killed the game by Paul’s two mid-range pitches. It’s too difficult, thunder is too difficult, and want to cash in talent with a large number of draft rights. At this stage, it seems that Paul doesn’t agree!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn't agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team/2842d477f49a401aa6b39b85cd2385e7.jpg" alt="Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn&#39;t agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team"><br>Take a look at the data of thunder. Gallinari has 16 points and 3 rebounds, Adams has 11 points and 11 rebounds, Alexander has 24 points and 3 rebounds, Paul has 20 points and 6 assists, and bezli has 10 points and 6 rebounds.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn't agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team/6788e3b0b9254b0dbd3161f1eed2c389.jpg" alt="Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn&#39;t agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team"><br>Throughout the first three quarters, you came and I went very busy. In the first quarter, Alexander, Paul, Gallinari and bezley hit three points in a row. At the end of the quarter, magic relied on Aminu and Gordon to slowly reduce the difference to five points. The second section of the deadlock between the two sides, to score is not easy, half-time is still 5 points difference. In the third quarter, thunder began to rain again, and after a wave of 9-0 climax, thunder suddenly hit the iron! The magic take this opportunity to rely on vucevic and Aminu points, the end of three quarters, magic behind 2 points.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn't agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team/01e551be57484eda96c1a8c46413053a.jpg" alt="Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn&#39;t agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team"><br>In the fourth quarter, the two sides got 4 points in the first four minutes, then bezley’s three points and Alexander’s jump shot opened the difference, while magic relied on fultz and Isaac to narrow the difference again. At the critical moment, Alexander scored three points once, helped Adams fly once and Paul made two mid shots. The game lost suspense, and the score was set at 102-94!<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn't agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team/c85091a0a92f4b5d937e65e075e8df16.jpg" alt="Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn&#39;t agree! Thunder won the third, Paul led the team to catch up with the old team"><br>Is it hard to lose a game? It’s not hard, but at present, the thunder is really trying its best in every game. Look at a few sets of data. Compared with the 10.8 + 2.8 + 3.3 of the same period last season, Alexandria has increased to 22.1 + 6.6 + 3.1. With unlimited shooting power and Paul’s connection with the team, Alexandria only needs to do a good job in the role of scorer! Compared with last season, Paul’s average of 15.6 points per game proves that his condition has not declined, and his assists have been reduced from 8.2 to 4.7, which is really impossible. The current personnel structure of thunder really can’t make Paul turn every subtle pass into a score. As a young player, Diallo’s score increased from 3.7 to 9.4, Noel’s score increased from 4.9 to 7.3, and everyone’s progress is still obvious.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn't agree!

Robertson, who has been absent for 2 years due to ligament tear, has started to resume training. At present, with the deepening of the game and the increase of tacit understanding of several new players, the thunder may have better results in the future, because Paul is the unbeaten leader.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2020/11/10/Want to put on a bad show, but Paul doesn't agree!

It’s hard to imagine. After all, one is aiming at the so-called impact on the championship, and the other is really falling down. But Paul doesn’t seem to agree. If he wants to continue to fight like this, maybe thunderbolt has to find a way to send Paul away. That’s not a bad thing!</p>
